In June 2014, CWRC created a list of 4,789 Canadian libraries and archives,
including their homepages.

The CWRC data is available in JSON. We can use this as a starting point for
polling Canadian cultural institutions and collect linked open data that they
might be expressing on their homepages, such as hours of operation, branch
locations, or contact information.
