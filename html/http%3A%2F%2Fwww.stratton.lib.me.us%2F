    <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">Our mission here at the Stratton
      Public Library is to offer as wide a variety of books and services
      as possible for the small town that we live in. We offer material
      for all age groups and welcome your suggestions. Besides our great
      selection of books, we have magazines, VHS videos and DVD's, and
      audio books on cassette and compact disc. We also have a small
      section of large print books plus some from Maine State Library on
      loan each month. For anything we don't have Maine State Library
      will loan it to us, so just ask! We have wireless internet and
      three computers which are available for public use at no charge. </h4>

    Library books are checked out for 3 weeks and videos for 3 days.
    There are no late fees but there is a container for donations on the
    counter. If a book is lost or needs replacing due to damage we
    maintain the right to revoke library privileges until said book is
    paid for. Library cards are free to residents of Stratton/Eustis,
    Coplin and Carrabassett, Kingfield and Rangeley, other nonresidents
    will asked to pay a refundable deposit of $25.00. <br>

    </h3>
    "Netiquette" is short for "Internet etiquette". Like everyday
    etiquette, it is based on respect for the rights of others, in this
    case, the library, its equipment, and its other users. Besides
    following the Computer Guidelines above, this means that you do
    nothing that might offend other users of the library or of the
    computers.You do not call up sites with explicit sexual references
    or graphics. If you should get onto such a site without meaning to,
    you get out of it right away (Clicking on &lt;BACK&gt; on the tool
    bar at the top is the fastest way).
