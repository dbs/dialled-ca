Its Board of Directors, consisting of 12 people elected annually from the community, and its staff, continue to govern well and to provide the leadership necessary to sustain existing commitments, and at the same time foster controlled heritage growth.</font></p>

It is located on the top floor of the Museum. The collection includes tens of thousands of photographs, all old Cranbrook Newspaper volumes (over 100 volumes) from 1898 to 1975 and representing the <em>Herald</em> (1898-1927), the <em>Prospector</em> (1912-1914), the <em>Courier</em> (1919-1973), the <em>Tribune</em> (1931-1933), the <em>Townsman</em> (1947-1975), and the <em>Kootenay Advertiser</em> (1973-1975). There are also many books, maps, pamphlets and other archival items for both Cranbrook and the railway. <br>

A highlight of the development was the display of one of the trains (the 1929 Trans Canada Limited)  at Expo '86 in Vancouver for six months &ndash; a rare move of irreplaceable heritage not likely to be ever repeated. <br>

This &ldquo;Cranbrook Museum Experience&rdquo; includes several parts and is a departure from the normal type of static museum often encountered since it is designed to constantly change to reflect many aspects of Cranbrook history in detail.

          <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> b)	A large digital heritage tour map of the city titled &ldquo;Explore Historic Cranbrook&rdquo; with 96 listings as of 2011 (approx 6&rsquo; wide x 5&rsquo; high).

The <strong>Exhibition Galleries</strong> are a second stage of development to encourage continuing investigation into Cranbrook history and are located on the upper floor or the historic Freight Shed. These 5 flexible gallery space, covering about 3,000 square feet, are designed for temporary exhibitions of local history and art, along with traveling exhibitions from other Museums and Galleries to provide fresh exhibits perpetually for local audiences and for visitors for the Museum. An adjacent Caf&eacute; looks down the long Gallery as well as out over the railway tracks and the Freight Shed garden. This service is intended to provide a social space for visitors and local residents, as well as revenue to assist the Gallery operations by being for lease to the private sector.
