                            <p>Welcome to the website of the Resource Library for the Environment and the Law. Our Resource Library is housed in the offices of the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA) at 130 Spadina Avenue Suite 301, in Toronto, Ontario Canada. CELA, a community legal aid clinic specializing in environmental law has built this collection since 1970. It currently contains 15,000 essential publications on environmental and policy in Ontario, and Canada as well as some international materials. Legal Aid Ontario has provided funding for this collection. It is intended to assist CELA staff, the public, environmental and legal communities to access information and tools to further environmental justice. </p>
                            <div class="heading">Accessing Our Resources:</div>
                            <p>This website contains the catalogue of our collection
                              database, including numerous topical research files.
                              The collection reflects
                              the multidisciplinary nature of many environmental
                              issues with a focus on environmental law and policy.
                              Topic areas of particular strength include environmental
                              assessment and land use planning, environmental
                              law, protection of the Great Lakes, pesticides
                              and other toxic substances, international trade
                              and investment issues, environmental health, waste
                              management and water quality and quantity. Our
                              library is also used as a meeting space so we ask
                              that you call (416) 960-2284 to book a time for
                              your visit. Materials can be used in the Resource
                              Library but not signed out. There are photocopy
                              facilities as well as a library computer for public
                              use. Researchers who are unable to visit our library
                              may call and request some materials from the collection
                              or receive advice on other locations where they
                              may be found by contacting Sarah Miller at (416)

                              has generated many of the materials in our shared
                              collection. The most recent of
                                these materials and a wealth of information on
                                environmental
                                  issues are available on their website. In 2002

                                  room for new materials and to focus the current
                                  collection, early parts of our collection and
                                archival materials have been donated to Wilfrid

                                  a repository for these materials that complement
                                  their own collection. Over time they can be
                              accessed
