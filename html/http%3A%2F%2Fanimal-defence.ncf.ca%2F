	<h1>About Us - Animal Defence League of Canada (ADLC)</h1>

	<p>The ADLC was formed in 1958 and is governed by a volunteer Board of Directors. Our budget is dependent upon donations from our members and the 
	public. We are a not-for-profit organization, therefore our receipts cannot be used for income tax deductions. Our year-end financial statements are reviewed 
	by BDO Dunwoody LLP, Ottawa. ADLC's Annual General Meeting, which is open to the public, is held in March or April.</p>

	<p>We are opposed to all forms of animal exploitation and cruelty. This includes neglect of companion animals; animal-using research and testing in laboratories; 
	trapping and "factory farming" of fur-bearing animals (including cats and dogs, i.e. as in China); game farming, commercial sealing and whaling, exploitation of 
	animals by zoos, circuses and aquariums, in so-called "sports" and "entertainments" such as hunting and rodeos. We are concerned about the abuse involved in raising, 
	transporting and slaughtering food animals. We especially abhor "factory farms" (cows, calves, pigs and poultry kept indoors in close confinement). By reducing or 
	eliminating meat from your diet, you can greatly reduce the suffering and death of many animals while improving your health and the environment at the same time. 
	We recommend a vegetarian diet.</p>

	<p>To inform the public about the oppression of animals and how to prevent or alleviate animal exploitation, cruelty and suffering, we disseminate literature, advertise in 
	newspapers and elsewhere, give talks to groups, write to various government officials and departments as well as to newspaper editors, and make ourselves available for media 
	interviews. We support other animal-rights groups in shared causes.  We publish a news bulletin twice a year to inform our members and the public of current activities and issues. </p>

	<div class="page-break"></div>

	<p>There is a new animal-concerned activist group in Ottawa that has a very similar name to Animal Defence League of Canada. This has caused some confusion for the public and the media. 
	You can contact us to confirm whether it was our group that has you concerned. Groups with a name similar to ours are not part of our organization. Each group should have both the credit
	and responsibility for their actions.</p>
