        <h1>Energy</h1>
        <p>Clean&#039;s Energy programs help people save money and improve the environment by making energy choices  -- sometimes all this takes are small changes at an individual level to generate a positive impact on a large scale.  <br />
<br />
To date, Clean has helped reduce energy use in Nova Scotia by over 160 gigawatt hours (GWh). To help put that number in perspective, it&#039;s the equivalent of removing the annual energy consumption of over 14,500 homes from Nova Scotia&#039;s electricity grid!</p>

        <p>Water is a basic necessity for life. However, having too much or too little water can be problematic. Clean Foundation can help you with water conservation inside your home and with rainwater management on your property.<br />
 <br />
Quality is just as important as quantity when it comes to water, so Clean also provides opportunities for you to take action to improve the health of your watershed and manage the waste water you produce. Our work includes stream restoration projects to improve habitat quality for fish, an innovative Atlantic Reef Ball program that fosters healthier marine environments,  and the award-winning Ship-to-Shore waste reduction program.</p>

We recognize that educators work hard to meet curriculum goals, so our programs are aligned with specific and general curriculum targets for each age group to facilitate smooth integration into the classroom. Clean’s popular workshops have engaged students from across the province to help develop the next generation of environmental leaders.<br />

We also help connect young Nova Scotians with paid summer employment in the environmental sector through the Nova Scotia Youth Conservation Corps.</p>

Clean Foundation is committed to helping individuals, workplaces and the public make the shift toward sustainable transportation. <br />

Our transportation information can help you identify areas for improvement and provide resources to assist in implementing changes. We also give you tools to help tell others that we can make a big impact through small changes in transportation choices.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t get us wrong – we’re proud to help make Nova Scotia, well, cleaner. Just last year, our Great Pick-Me-Up supported 18,000 people across our province, who collectively picked up over 6,000 bags of garbage, and 700 bags of recyclables. It’s the largest volunteer-driven community clean-up program in Nova Scotia.</p>

<p><a href="http://clean.ns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DoNotLikeLitter.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-15231"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-15231" src="http://clean.ns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/DoNotLikeLitter.jpg" alt="DoNotLikeLitter" width="472" height="712" /></a> Litter, sadly, remains a grimy reality in too many communities. It’s an eyesore, harms our tourism industry, poses health risks, and affects water quality. Wildlife often mistake it as food.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nova Scotia is surrounded by ocean, and 80 percent of the massive amounts of plastics ending up in our seas is coming from land. Even if litter starts on terra firma, since we all live in a watershed that small piece of litter will most likely make its way, via streams, lakes and rivers, to the ocean. Remember the whale that washed ashore near Halifax, its belly full of plastic?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we wish people wouldn’t litter and we didn’t have to organize clean-ups. But the messy truth is that even if people didn’t litter, our trash will still get into the environment. Curbside garbage bags that get blown away or picked apart by crows. Trash flies off garbage trucks. Park and playground trash tins overflow and spill over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all litter, even when we don’t litter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to reduce our waste in the first place. As consumers, we need to be more aware of the products we buy – and the packaging they come in. (We actually saw in a grocery store a pre-peeled orange that was then put in a plastic container. If only there was some type of natural, compostable, protective coating for oranges&#8230;) Customers can use reusable bags and buy in bulk. We can eschew the plastic utensils. We can stop buying so much throw-away junk. We can share products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a compostable nutshell, citizens just need to think more about our garbage – something we don’t always do. Last year, an audit of the Otter Lake landfill found that 47 percent of the trash showing up could have instead been recycled or composted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Highlighting the power we have as consumers, however, doesn’t mean letting businesses off the hook. A product’s design phase has the largest influence on the product’s lifecycle. If a company has to assume greater accountability for the life (and death) of their goods through some form of Extended Producer Responsibility, then repairable products that can be refurbished or at least easily recycled become more economically sound options to disposal. A lot of time, energy and raw material goes into consumer products, so let’s maximize value and minimize waste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can invest in quality products that just last longer. There is a growing movement called New Materialism that argues we need to embrace our ‘stuff’ in a different way. To help beat the throw-away waste crisis, we can design products that are beautiful and long-lasting. And when selling those beautiful products, companies should also cut down on the packaging – we’ve all seen the small product surrounded by a ridiculous amount of plastic packaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this Earth Day, let’s start reducing litter by reducing the amount of trash we throw out. We know it won’t happen overnight, so in the meantime, lend a hand to the thousands of volunteers out there picking up after ourselves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scott Skinner was previously Vice President of Atlantic Operations and Business Development for Summerhill Group, an energy efficiency company that works across North America. Under his leadership, Summerhill has grown substantially in the East, and now has working partnerships with Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, New Brunswick Power, and New Hampshire Electric Cooperative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He holds an MBA from Dalhousie University, Bachelor of Commerce from Saint Mary’s, and a Human Resources Management Certificate also from Saint Mary’s. Mr. Skinner sits on the Board of Wind4All Communities, a Community Economic Development Investment Fund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ve known and worked with Scott off and on for close to 10 years and am excited to have him taking over as the new ED at Clean,” says Marcus Goodick, vice-chair of Clean’s Board of Directors. “I think he will do an excellent job managing existing programs and helping to guide the growth of Clean into the future.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean works on critical ecological issues including energy &amp; climate change, water, waste reduction and sustainable transportation. And while we work directly on green solutions – we may be Clean, but we don’t mind getting our hands dirty – we know that education on environmental issues is critical to long-term change.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><em>In advance of Nova Scotia’s 2016/17 Budget, a diversity of groups have come together to urge provincial government to develop a carbon pricing system for Nova Scotia based on 5 key principles. The groups represent labour, anti-poverty, environmental, and social justice communities across the province. Here&#8217;s their open letter to Premier McNeil and Finance Minister Delorey:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OPEN LETTER: </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Anti-Poverty, Fair Economy, Labour and Environmental Advocates Agree on Five Key Principles for a made-in-Nova Scotia Carbon Pricing System</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Premier McNeil and Finance Minister Delorey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dramatic social and economic costs of a changing climate are well-documented, requiring an immediate and multi-pronged strategy on the part of governments to meet the challenges faced today, which will continue to intensify for future generations. Canada’s commitment to the Paris target of limiting average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius means we need to increase the ambition of our provincial climate plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nova Scotia’s investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy, combined with the province’s legislated caps on greenhouse gas emissions, have set our electricity sector on the right course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work remains in addressing carbon pollution from other sources, like transportation. At the same time, it is clear that energy affordability is a top concern for Nova Scotians especially for those living on low and moderate incomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Done right, a made-in-Nova Scotia approach to carbon pricing can help us target the sources of pollution our current laws are missing, while also giving us new financial resources we can use to help vulnerable people and invest in our communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carbon pricing is the new norm in Canada with five provinces, representing almost 90% of the country’s population, committed to a carbon tax or cap and trade system. The federal government is clear about its intentions to work with provinces as they design carbon pricing policies. Clearly some form of carbon pricing is coming to Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now is the moment to take advantage of political momentum and relatively low oil prices to design a carbon pricing system tailored to Nova Scotia’s particular circumstances and needs. Failure to do so may result in hasty adoption later, amid increasing pressure from the Federal government and nearby jurisdictions with their own systems. Nova Scotia can choose to lead the way in our region, or we will be forced to follow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We, the undersigned, urge Nova Scotia government to use carbon pricing as a tool to take us where we need to go as a province.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nova Scotia needs to begin a conversation about how carbon pricing can work for us. We understand that there are a variety of approaches our province might take to putting a price on carbon pollution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We offer the following five principles as key elements of any approach we ultimately develop for a Nova Scotia carbon price:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Effective:</strong> the price should start at a level in line with other Canadian systems and increase at regular, predictable intervals to a level that is high enough to serve as a disincentive to environmentally harmful activities and an incentive for shifts to cleaner technologies. Keeping in line with other jurisdictions does mean that the price alone will not be high enough to reduce emissions to the level necessary and, therefore, the revenue from the price must be used to support a just and equitable transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fair:</strong> government must compensate low- to middle-income households so that modest income households can afford higher prices and low income households are more energy secure than they are at present. Therefore, for low income households this compensation must cover more than the extra costs associated with a carbon price and compensation must increase as the price increases. Carbon pricing should also not adversely affect the public sector so that services are not cut or restricted to accommodate higher costs because that will disproportionately affect low income households.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, part of the revenue generated from a carbon price should be used to support Nova Scotia’s low-carbon transition, with a portion allocated to projects and initiatives that support the social and economic development of low-income communities and households, in conjunction with low-carbon initiatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transparent: </strong>design and implement a price that is easy to understand by Nova Scotians including the impact on the environment, the economy, and their own household. The government should enshrine these principles in law and legislate requirements about exactly how revenue will be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Efficient: </strong>as much as possible, make use of existing regulatory infrastructure to administer a carbon pricing system to ensure that the system is low cost to implement and operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Economically Sustainable:</strong> ensure that the price fosters a low-carbon economic transition, which does not have an adverse impact on workers or the economy (both rural and urban), by coupling the introduction of a carbon price with public investment to generate green job opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, a carbon price is only one essential piece in a suite of policies within a broader climate change prevention and mitigation framework. If implemented using these five principles, carbon pricing, alongside complementary regulations and standards, promises a wealth of co-benefits for Nova Scotians: reduced illness and morbidity; lower provincial healthcare costs; reduced energy poverty; decreased overall household spending as energy efficiency and access to renewables improves; and the growth of green-sector jobs to support a low-carbon transition, allowing more Nova Scotians to stay here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nova Scotia government should immediately create a multi-sectoral working group on this issue, including environmental, anti-poverty and fair economy groups.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>Clean Foundation has signed a new five-year agreement with the Nova Scotia Department of Environment to continue delivering the innovative Nova Scotia Youth Conservation Corps program. The Province has also increased their funding to $100,000 per year.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managed by Clean Foundation, a non-profit environmental organization based in Nova Scotia, the Youth Corps provides youth aged 15-30 with training and employment opportunities in the environmental field. It also helps build the capacity of communities in Nova Scotia while improving their local environment. The Youth Corps, a program started in 1989 by the Nova Scotia Environment dept., has since helped thousands of youth better the environment and gain the career skills they need to successfully enter the green economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, 58 students worked on projects with non-profit organizations, community groups, municipalities and First Nation’s groups throughout the province. The Youth Corps has both a 9-week summer employment program, and a 15-week leadership program that focuses on under- and unemployment youth, most notably in rural and First Nations communities. Clean is now accepting applications for summer placements and will continue to do so until the end of May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of the types of projects the students work on include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Active transportation and trail development</li>
<li>Stream restoration and water quality testing</li>
<li>Pollinator, food, and rain garden installation</li>
<li>Wildlife rehabilitation and conservation</li>
<li>Environmentally focused children’s day camps</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia, more than half of our young people leave the province after graduation. And it can be difficult to get local jobs without experience. Clean believes that offering youth environmental skills and awareness is crucial to the economic and environmental sustainability of our province.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>A diverse network of environmental thinkers from across the Maritimes – including Clean Foundation’s Gina Patterson, Director of Policy &amp; Strategic Relations – met in Charlottetown in February to come up with recommendations designed to spur community innovation and sustainable job creation throughout the region.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2016 <em>Charlottetown Initiative on the Maritimes’ Sustainable Energy Transition</em> was an opportunity to contemplate the regional implications of, and opportunities offered by, recent UN climate negotiations in Paris, and the election of a federal government committed to a new model of climate action in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Initiative</em> brought together more than 30 individuals representing the business, academic, and civil society communities of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>You can download the  <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/CharlottetownInitiative-Priorities-for-Action.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">Charlottetown Initiative Priorities for Action</a>. The ideas are grouped under four high-level opportunities for immediate, collaborative action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Renew long-term climate plans</li>
<li>Enable local, distributed community energy</li>
<li>Focus on energy efficiency</li>
<li>Decarbonize &amp; electrify heat and transport</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Charlottetown meetings – which included representatives of community groups, universities, municipalities and renewable-energy businesses – also established a network that will continue to share resources and support clean energy and economy objectives in the Maritimes in the coming years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network has plans to present the recommendations to each of the provincial governments and will continue to solicit sign-on from supportive stakeholders across the region.

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>Clean Foundation welcomes the agreement adopted at the COP21 global climate conference. It’s both a challenge to societies to choose a low carbon future, and a signal to markets that there is international consensus on the importance of this transition.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The miracle of COP21 is that for the first time in history, our future is set on a low carbon pathway,&#8221; says Gina Patterson, Clean’s Director of Policy and Strategic Relations, who attended the Paris conference. &#8220;Almost 200 countries submitted outlines on what contributions they will make to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. This means that 90% of the world’s emissions have climate action strategies. This is historic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real purpose of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agreement is important for many reasons, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The science on climate change was respected, as most scientists consider 1.5 degrees C the threshold to limit catastrophic climate change impacts, particularly in coastal communities.</li>
<li>It’s a truly global agreement, with all countries expected to pitch in. Previous treaties only included richer countries. Canada sign on to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but backed out in 2011; the U.S. never signed it.</li>
<li>The deal also includes financial commitments from developed nations that will help developing countries combat climate change impacts and adopt cleaner technologies. The annual dollar amounts are considered to be the floor for further financial commitments beyond 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean is also heartened by the positive role that Canada played at COP21. &#8220;Our Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, was so effective that she was invited to be a negotiator, meaning she was instrumental in this agreement becoming what it is,&#8221; says Clean’s Patterson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To implement the treaty, we need deep and rapid cuts to greenhouse gas pollution, with an almost complete transition away from fossil fuels by 2050. This will be achieved through:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the voluntary commitments countries have made to reduce their emissions by 2030</li>
<li>Regular and transparent reviews of those targets</li>
<li>Policy and market mechanisms that encourage a broad adoption of low carbon business and tech.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada has never before met any of its national emissions reduction targets. Fortunately, we are seeing leadership from the provinces, with Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia held up as examples of strong climate policy. Prime Minister Trudeau has promised a framework of Canada’s climate policy within 90 days of the Paris negotiations. Now is the time to ensure our regions are positioning our communities and economies for the low carbon future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe much more can, and must, be done in Atlantic Canada, especially as a majority of our population lives in coastal areas. Climate change is not an abstract concept for those of us facing erosion and flooding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean looks forward to stronger commitments from regional governments so that our workforce and our communities will not be left behind in this transition to a new economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nova Scotia has made strides in reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). By 2020, 40% of the province’s electricity will come from renewable sources. But the majority of energy will still come from high emissions-producing, non-renewable resources – so there is much more work to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have to work to reduce GHGs from high-emitting sectors outside of electricity generation such as the building and transportation; the latter accounts for 25% of Nova Scotia’s total emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are substantial obstacles to a low carbon future – we know it won’t be easy – we choose to see this issue of our times as one of possibility. It’s a chance to transition to an economy with the types of meaningful, greener jobs that ensures future generations believe there is indeed a future here for them in our region. And it&#8217;s an opportunity to work in solidarity with those globally and within our nations &#8211; including Indigenous Peoples &#8211; who are the most vulnerable to changes in our climate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will not happen all at once. We need to ensure it is a compassionate transition for our labour force. We need to ensure our various policies are aligned and not competing with one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time for action is now. As the President of France Francois Hollande reflected at the signing, we will not be judged on a clause in a sentence, but on the text as a whole. We will not be judged on one day but on the century. We will not be judged on one word, but on the action.</p>

<p>Nova Scotia has shown national leadership on waste reduction and energy efficiency – we want to celebrate those champions working to ensure our province does its share on the climate change issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 2020, 40% of Nova Scotia’s electricity will come from renewable sources. However, the majority of energy will still come from high emissions-producing, non-renewable resources – so there is more work to do.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>The next Global Climate Conference (also known as COP21) will be held in Paris from November 30th to December 11th. Canada and almost 200 other countries, as well as thousands of organizations, will work to adopt a universal agreement to limit global emissions production and help societies transition to low-carbon economies.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is consensus among most governments and scientists that to keep the climate system in balance requires us to limit warming below an average of 2°C above pre-industrial levels by century’s end. Each country must submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/talking-climate-change-with-kids/global-climate-conference-in-paris/">COP21</a> and a summary of these contributions has been created to represent the cumulative impact of these national efforts and to determine if they are enough to limit warming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without the Paris commitments, with business as usual, we are on track to see 4-6 °C warming by the end of the century. This would mean significant changes to the Earth as we know it. If all the commitments in the INDC’s are carried out, the Earth will likely experience a warming of 2.7°C by 2100. We are close, but more aggressive commitments and accelerated ambition are needed to keep our planet below 2°C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the early days of international climate change summits, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been actively involved, attending sessions and exchanging views with other participants, including delegates. It is recognized that this involvement allows vital experience, expertise, information and perspectives from civil society to be brought into the process to generate new insights and approaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the access and participation of observers to the process promotes transparency in this increasingly complex universal problem. Such participation flourishes in an atmosphere of mutual trust which acknowledges respect for others and their opinions, and takes into account the nature of intergovernmental sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean Foundation will be attending the Climate Conference to learn from other delegates, and to share our experience, particularly in the following areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/">Youth engagement</a> in air quality, climate change, renewables, and energy efficiency (we have  over 20 years&#8217; experience in the schools, engaging thousands of children each year).</li>
<li>Supporting <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/talking-climate-change-with-kids/">elementary school engagement</a> with COP21 across Canada.</li>
<li>Collaborative, multi-sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation, as is being piloted with our <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/water/atlantic-stormwater/">Atlantic Stormwater Initiative</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/nova-scotia-youth-conservation-corps-2/">Youth training, internships and mentoring</a> for success in a green economy.</li>
<li>Energy efficiency program design and implementation to address <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/energy/homewarming-low-income-homeowner-energy-upgrades/">energy poverty</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/waste/ship-to-shore/">Fisher engagement</a> in ocean literacy and stewardship.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also interested in learning about other methods of supporting local and national targets, including climate finance, climate policy, adaptation strategies, municipal leadership and micro-financing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know how important it is to tackle climate change. It’s affecting animals, wild spaces, communities and even the economy. That’s why the upcoming Global Climate Conference is a critical opportunity for the world to come together to chart a new path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe it’s vital to involve as many young people as we can. We know they care about the Earth and their communities. We also know that given the chance, they have strong opinions and clear ideas about how to fix the problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be a very important Global Climate Conference in Paris from November 30th to December 11th. Canada and almost 200 other countries, as well as thousands of organizations, will work to adopt a universal agreement to limit global emissions production and help societies transition to low-carbon economies. It will be one of the biggest international summits ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean Foundation is providing <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/talking-climate-change-with-kids/">climate change resources to equip elementary-level educators</a> with information and activities that can be easily integrated into their daily lessons. We hope this will help teachers involve students and promote discussion about the important negotiations in Paris that will have a direct impact on their futures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“All new governments bring renewed energy and ideas, and Clean looks forward to federal action on the environment and the realities of climate change,” says Chris Morrissey, Executive Director of Clean Foundation.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as an organization based in the Atlantic, Clean also welcomes Mr. Hunter Tootoo as the new Minister of Fisheries of Oceans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean encourages all level of governments in Canada to work for sustainable development. “A healthy environment is the foundation of a healthy economy and society, no matter where you live, what your cultural background is, or where you sit on the political spectrum,” adds Morrissey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By adding Climate Change to the name of the environment department, the new government has signaled the importance of climate issues in Canada. Reducing carbon pollution is critical for our environment, and also offers economic opportunities in areas such as clean energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Government has said it will work with provincial governments on climate change, and Clean encourages the government to also involve the many non-profit organizations across Canada that are working hard to improve our environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean is also pleased to see a Federal Cabinet that is reflective of the diversity of Canada, and joins Mi’kmaq civil society groups in welcoming the increased presence of Indigenous Peoples at the highest levels of government power in Canada.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p>It can rain – a lot – during any season in Atlantic Canada. And with climate change models showing our region will experience storms of increasing severity in coming years, Clean Foundation wants to help mitigate some of the problem associated with all this water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The non-profit organization is launching a three-year Atlantic Stormwater Initiative to help people in the region adapt to climate change, as well as improve the health and long-term sustainability of the Atlantic ecosystem through better stormwater management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A November 9<sup>th</sup> one-day conference will be the kick-off event for the Atlantic Stormwater Initiative. Attending will be urban developers, government officials, NGOs and First Nations groups.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stormwater, also known as ‘runoff’, is the water that runs over surfaces like roads, buildings and agricultural land instead of seeping into the ground. This runoff can accumulate quickly and cause flooding and erosion. It also picks up pollutants and debris, and runs into our streams, rivers and lakes untreated. Conventional stormwater management channels excess water into storm drains and sewers as quickly as possible, leading to overflowing systems and water contamination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlantic Stormwater Initiative has been developed by Clean to better manage water quantity and flow, while mitigating the associated impacts to water quality, habitat and biodiversity. This project will improve the capacity of communities to lessen stormwater risks and threats due to climate change, and better protect water quality, habitat and biodiversity. The project will bring together experts and stakeholders throughout Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Newfoundland &amp; Labrador to address stormwater-related impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this project, Clean will support the design and installation of effective demonstration sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean has received close to $200,000 for the project through Environment Canada’s Atlantic Ecosystem Initiatives. Clean’s Atlantic Stormwater Initiative is also supported by the City of Charlottetown, Halifax Water, CBCL, and TD Friends of the Environment Fund.</p>

<p>Clean Foundation encourages all Nova Scotians to think about the waste they produce, and how they can reduce it – for the benefit of both the environment and the economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean believes we can reduce the amount of waste we produce and prevent it from accumulating in our communities and in natural areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a first step in the program, Clean will host a stormwater conference in November as part of a collaborative planning session amongst stormwater experts and stakeholders.</p>

<p>The Nova Scotia Youth Conservation Corps (NSYCC) was established in 1989 by the Province of Nova Scotia – Clean Foundation has been delivering NSYCC on behalf of Nova Scotia Environment since September 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The goal of the program is to provide Nova Scotia’s youth, aged 15-30, with training and employment opportunities within the environmental field, while providing services to communities in Nova Scotia for the betterment of the local environment. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nova Scotia Youth Conservation Corps (NSYCC) builds connections between youth and local organizations to stimulate stewardship for the natural environment and support the emergence of young community leaders. This is accomplished by providing students with training and employment opportunities through paid work placements with community-based organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another NSYCC priority is to equip youth with the aptitude to become leaders in their communities while delivering meaningful environmental projects across the province.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>The Clean Foundation has partnered with the Halifax Blue Nose Marathon for the second year. We are helping them make the event more environmentally responsible</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the marathon has switched from water bottles to using hydrants for the water stations. Halifax Transit is offering all registrants with a race bib free bus and ferry service on race day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean volunteers will help maintain recycling bins, and our hybrid cars will be used by Blue Nose representatives during the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And our Clean Foundation bike valet service will return. Located in the Grand Parade Square, free bike storage will be available Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>Congratulations to Jill McSweeney, an Interdisciplinary PhD Candidate with Dalhousie University and recipient of this year’s Clean Postgraduate Research Scholarship.</strong> Jill receives $2,000 to contribute to her research expenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am very honoured that the Clean Foundation found my research deserving of the scholarship!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jill’s research focuses on understanding the human-nature relationship, and how engaging in nature can benefit us physically, psychologically, socially and spiritually. “I am currently investigating how nature exposure directly impacts stress, mood, and altruistic behaviour, and how engaging with nature can foster a sense of connection and relatedness with our environment.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goals of her research are both to better understand how to improve the health and wellbeing of our communities, and to increase environmental awareness in the participants to change these individuals’ perceptiveness and feelings toward the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean hopes to draw upon Jill’s research in our quest to inspire the individual actions that add up to positive environmental change.</p>

              <h3 class="title"><a href="#"><span>Earth Day could also be Green Jobs Day - a message from the Clean Foundation</span></a></h3>
              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p>Today is Earth Day, a day to reflect on the environment, and on how we can lesson our impact on the natural world that sustain us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for too many in our province, it’s also ‘try to find a job’ day or ‘watch your child move out west’ day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stats are alarming. A shrinking population and tax base. A stagnant economy. Traditional industries in decline. Rural towns decorated with out-of-business signs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These stats have a human face. Sons and daughters going down the road because of a lack of employment. First Nations’ youth not offered the chance to unlock their potential. Immigrants not finding opportunity here so they continue their journey elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve heard the warnings of the One Nova Scotia Commission – change our way of thinking, and do it now or never because soon it will be too late. Nova Scotia needs entrepreneurs and business start-ups. We need revenue to maintain our schools and our hospitals. We need a deeply welcoming society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an environmental organization with over 25 years of experience, the Clean Foundation also knows we need to better manage our natural resources. We need to clean up our waterways, and reduce our waste. And most of all, we need to confront the realities of climate change, to help stave off the devastating consequences of too many greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those stats are also alarming, and they too have a human face. There are economic and social costs to climate change that we – and our children and grandchildren – will pay, one way or another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we chart a course to the new economy, let’s also tackle the challenge of climate change. We <i>can</i> use economic levers to create incentives for industries to transition away from fossil fuels. We <i>can</i> create the green collar jobs that keep future generations believing that this future is possible here. We <i>can</i> create the healthy environment and vibrant society that attracts newcomers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we have to take risks, be creative, and engage in smart and bold conversations that are not immediately dispersed by the prism of politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In practice, this means a moratorium on shale gas fracking is not the end of a debate, but another chapter in an ongoing discourse about energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means adding value to our natural resources. It means taxing the bad stuff – pollution and greenhouse gases – instead of just the good stuff like jobs and wages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for our province to move beyond the ‘versus’ economy. Jobs vs the environment. City vs countryside. Nova Scotians vs come-from-aways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a strong equitable economy that is rooted in a healthy environment. We know it won’t be easy. But we’ve been innovators before. Nova Scotia led the way with a system that diverted 50 percent of waste from our landfills. A quarter of our electricity will come from renewables by the end of this year, and over 40 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we’ve become a leader in energy efficiency. For our part, the Clean Foundation has helped prevent 110,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being released into the atmosphere. That’s equivalent to removing the annual energy consumption of over 14,000 homes from Nova Scotia’s electricity grid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Energy efficiency not only saves money and reduces our carbon footprint, it also supports local businesses doing this work – a green industry that will continue to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is now more employment in Canada’s clean energy sector than in the oil sands. That’s the future. That’s jobs <i>and</i> the environment.</p>

              <h3 class="title"><a href="#"><span>The Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up litter campaign now welcoming team registrations</span></a></h3>
              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>The Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up – Nova Scotia’s largest litter reduction initiative – launches this spring.</strong> Registrations are now open for teams across the province at <a title="Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up" href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/waste/great-nova-scotia-pick-me-up/" target="_blank">www.nspickmeup.ca</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spring weather will eventually arrive, and with it the litter and garbage underneath all that melting snow. After a particularly long winter and an unprecedented amount of snow, litter will make an unsightly appearance as never before. The Clean Foundation has a solution and is inviting all Nova Scotians (families, youth, individuals, businesses and schools) to take part in the Great Pick-Me-Up, our long-standing anti-litter program and one of the largest volunteer initiatives in the province.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With support from municipalities, Clean will provide teams with everything they need to run a successful litter clean-up event. Groups can register by calling (902) 420-3474 or by going online at <a title="Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up" href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/waste/great-nova-scotia-pick-me-up/" target="_blank">nspickmeup.ca</a>. Clean will send a free kit that includes supplies, information on how to coordinate your event and a data card to track results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Litter is an eyesore, poses health risks, affects water quality, and is often mistaken as food for wildlife. Studies show people tend to litter in areas where there is already garbage on the ground. That’s why Clean wants Nova Scotians to pick it up and promote clean communities this spring – and throughout the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Clean is proud to facilitate litter clean-ups. It brings groups and individuals together and helps them improve the quality of life in their communities, while also helping the local environment,”  says Chris Morrissey, Clean Foundation’s Executive Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean is encouraging teams to post ‘before &amp; after’ photos of their pick-me-up locations and post to social media using the hashtag <strong>#GladToCleanUp.</strong></p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p>Halifax Harbour is a functioning estuary that shelters numerous fisheries that are of recreational, commercial and aboriginal importance, including Gaspereau, American eel and Atlantic salmon. The rivers that flow into the harbour are essential watercourses for fish to access freshwater spawning grounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sawmill River, in downtown Dartmouth, is one such river that connects Halifax Harbour to some of the largest water bodies in the Dartmouth area. Forty-three years ago, a 700 meter length of the Sawmill River was buried in a pipe underground, creating a barrier that prevents fish from moving to their essential spawning grounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The barrier of the Sawmill River remains to this day. The Halifax Water Commission will soon be replacing this underground pipe along the length of the Sawmill River to accommodate elevated precipitation loads due to climate change. In this replacement, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans is requiring that fish passage be restored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A variety of environmental, aboriginal and recreational organizations and local businesses are encouraging the city and the water commission to “daylight” the Sawmill River to bring economic, environmental, recreational, and social benefits to the community of Dartmouth.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daylighting describes projects that deliberately expose some or all of the flow of a previously covered river, creek, or stormwater drainage. Daylighting of the Sawmill River will also complement the extensive work and investment of the City of Halifax to clean up the Harbour through improved sewage treatment in recent years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean Foundation has worked to restore adjacent watersheds such as the Cow Bay River, Little Salmon River, Smelt Run, Hornes Brook, and Gammon Lake Brook since 2006. Our watershed restoration team has developed expertise in watershed restoration and community engagement, stewardship and education about the benefits and requirements for healthy watercourses. The Sawmill River is literally in Clean Foundation’s backyard, and we see the value in daylighting this river, as it should be greatly beneficial to the fish that reside in Dartmouth area watercourses, Halifax Harbour and the Atlantic Ocean, while bringing urban renewal by bringing water and nature back into the heart of the city, and provide an excellent opportunity for community education and outreach in the benefits and services of clean and restored watersheds.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Clean Foundation supports the initiative to daylight the Sawmill River and commits to assisting the city of Halifax and Halifax Water Commission in maintaining exposed sections of the river.</strong>  Maintenance support from Clean Foundation could include habitat restoration, erosion control, debris clearing and removal and litter clean ups.</p>
