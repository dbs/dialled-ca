        <h1>Energy</h1>
        <p>Clean&#039;s Energy programs help people save money and improve the environment by making energy choices  -- sometimes all this takes are small changes at an individual level to generate a positive impact on a large scale.  <br />
<br />
To date, Clean has helped reduce energy use in Nova Scotia by over 160 gigawatt hours (GWh). To help put that number in perspective, it&#039;s the equivalent of removing the annual energy consumption of over 14,500 homes from Nova Scotia&#039;s electricity grid!</p>

        <p>Water is a basic necessity for life. However, having too much or too little water can be problematic. Clean Foundation can help you with water conservation inside your home and with rainwater management on your property.<br />
 <br />
Quality is just as important as quantity when it comes to water, so Clean also provides opportunities for you to take action to improve the health of your watershed and manage the waste water you produce. Our work includes stream restoration projects to improve habitat quality for fish, an innovative Atlantic Reef Ball program that fosters healthier marine environments,  and the award-winning Ship-to-Shore waste reduction program.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>A diverse network of environmental thinkers from across the Maritimes – including Clean Foundation’s Gina Patterson, Director of Policy &amp; Strategic Relations – met in Charlottetown in February to come up with recommendations designed to spur community innovation and sustainable job creation throughout the region.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2016 <em>Charlottetown Initiative on the Maritimes’ Sustainable Energy Transition</em> was an opportunity to contemplate the regional implications of, and opportunities offered by, recent UN climate negotiations in Paris, and the election of a federal government committed to a new model of climate action in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>Initiative</em> brought together more than 30 individuals representing the business, academic, and civil society communities of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download the  <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/CharlottetownInitiative-Priorities-for-Action.pdf" target="_blank" rel="">Charlottetown Initiative Priorities for Action</a>. The ideas are grouped under four high-level opportunities for immediate, collaborative action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Renew long-term climate plans</li>
<li>Enable local, distributed community energy</li>
<li>Focus on energy efficiency</li>
<li>Decarbonize &amp; electrify heat and transport</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Charlottetown meetings – which included representatives of community groups, universities, municipalities and renewable-energy businesses – also established a network that will continue to share resources and support clean energy and economy objectives in the Maritimes in the coming years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network has plans to present the recommendations to each of the provincial governments and will continue to solicit sign-on from supportive stakeholders across the region.

It’s both a challenge to societies to choose a low carbon future, and a signal to markets that there is international consensus on the importance of this transition.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The miracle of COP21 is that for the first time in history, our future is set on a low carbon pathway,&#8221; says Gina Patterson, Clean’s Director of Policy and Strategic Relations, who attended the Paris conference. &#8220;Almost 200 countries submitted outlines on what contributions they will make to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. This means that 90% of the world’s emissions have climate action strategies. This is historic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real purpose of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agreement is important for many reasons, including:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The science on climate change was respected, as most scientists consider 1.5 degrees C the threshold to limit catastrophic climate change impacts, particularly in coastal communities.</li>
<li>It’s a truly global agreement, with all countries expected to pitch in. Previous treaties only included richer countries. Canada sign on to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, but backed out in 2011; the U.S. never signed it.</li>
<li>The deal also includes financial commitments from developed nations that will help developing countries combat climate change impacts and adopt cleaner technologies. The annual dollar amounts are considered to be the floor for further financial commitments beyond 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean is also heartened by the positive role that Canada played at COP21. &#8220;Our Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Catherine McKenna, was so effective that she was invited to be a negotiator, meaning she was instrumental in this agreement becoming what it is,&#8221; says Clean’s Patterson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To implement the treaty, we need deep and rapid cuts to greenhouse gas pollution, with an almost complete transition away from fossil fuels by 2050. This will be achieved through:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementation of the voluntary commitments countries have made to reduce their emissions by 2030</li>
<li>Regular and transparent reviews of those targets</li>
<li>Policy and market mechanisms that encourage a broad adoption of low carbon business and tech.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canada has never before met any of its national emissions reduction targets. Fortunately, we are seeing leadership from the provinces, with Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia held up as examples of strong climate policy. Prime Minister Trudeau has promised a framework of Canada’s climate policy within 90 days of the Paris negotiations. Now is the time to ensure our regions are positioning our communities and economies for the low carbon future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe much more can, and must, be done in Atlantic Canada, especially as a majority of our population lives in coastal areas. Climate change is not an abstract concept for those of us facing erosion and flooding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean looks forward to stronger commitments from regional governments so that our workforce and our communities will not be left behind in this transition to a new economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nova Scotia has made strides in reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). By 2020, 40% of the province’s electricity will come from renewable sources. But the majority of energy will still come from high emissions-producing, non-renewable resources – so there is much more work to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have to work to reduce GHGs from high-emitting sectors outside of electricity generation such as the building and transportation; the latter accounts for 25% of Nova Scotia’s total emissions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there are substantial obstacles to a low carbon future – we know it won’t be easy – we choose to see this issue of our times as one of possibility. It’s a chance to transition to an economy with the types of meaningful, greener jobs that ensures future generations believe there is indeed a future here for them in our region. And it&#8217;s an opportunity to work in solidarity with those globally and within our nations &#8211; including Indigenous Peoples &#8211; who are the most vulnerable to changes in our climate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will not happen all at once. We need to ensure it is a compassionate transition for our labour force. We need to ensure our various policies are aligned and not competing with one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The time for action is now. As the President of France Francois Hollande reflected at the signing, we will not be judged on a clause in a sentence, but on the text as a whole. We will not be judged on one day but on the century. We will not be judged on one word, but on the action.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p>During the Global Climate Conference in Paris, the <a href="http://www.halifax.ca/home/" target="_blank">City of Halifax</a>, the <a href="https://www.ecologyaction.ca/" target="_blank">Ecology Action Centre</a> and Clean Foundation celebrated those Nova Scotian businesses, individuals, community groups and educators showing outstanding leadership around climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>On December 11th, 2015 at Halifax City Hall, we shone a spotlight on just some of the Nova Scotians championing our transition to a low-carbon economy, and those helping us to adapt to the impacts of climate change.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nova Scotia has shown national leadership on waste reduction and energy efficiency – we want to celebrate those champions working to ensure our province does its share on the climate change issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 2020, 40% of Nova Scotia’s electricity will come from renewable sources. However, the majority of energy will still come from high emissions-producing, non-renewable resources – so there is more work to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope the people honoured here continue to work on climate issues, and inspire more action in Atlantic Canada.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>The next Global Climate Conference (also known as COP21) will be held in Paris from November 30th to December 11th. Canada and almost 200 other countries, as well as thousands of organizations, will work to adopt a universal agreement to limit global emissions production and help societies transition to low-carbon economies.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is consensus among most governments and scientists that to keep the climate system in balance requires us to limit warming below an average of 2°C above pre-industrial levels by century’s end. Each country must submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions before <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/talking-climate-change-with-kids/global-climate-conference-in-paris/">COP21</a> and a summary of these contributions has been created to represent the cumulative impact of these national efforts and to determine if they are enough to limit warming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Without the Paris commitments, with business as usual, we are on track to see 4-6 °C warming by the end of the century. This would mean significant changes to the Earth as we know it. If all the commitments in the INDC’s are carried out, the Earth will likely experience a warming of 2.7°C by 2100. We are close, but more aggressive commitments and accelerated ambition are needed to keep our planet below 2°C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the early days of international climate change summits, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been actively involved, attending sessions and exchanging views with other participants, including delegates. It is recognized that this involvement allows vital experience, expertise, information and perspectives from civil society to be brought into the process to generate new insights and approaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the access and participation of observers to the process promotes transparency in this increasingly complex universal problem. Such participation flourishes in an atmosphere of mutual trust which acknowledges respect for others and their opinions, and takes into account the nature of intergovernmental sessions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean Foundation will be attending the Climate Conference to learn from other delegates, and to share our experience, particularly in the following areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/">Youth engagement</a> in air quality, climate change, renewables, and energy efficiency (we have  over 20 years&#8217; experience in the schools, engaging thousands of children each year).</li>
<li>Supporting <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/talking-climate-change-with-kids/">elementary school engagement</a> with COP21 across Canada.</li>
<li>Collaborative, multi-sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation, as is being piloted with our <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/water/atlantic-stormwater/">Atlantic Stormwater Initiative</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/nova-scotia-youth-conservation-corps-2/">Youth training, internships and mentoring</a> for success in a green economy.</li>
<li>Energy efficiency program design and implementation to address <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/energy/homewarming-low-income-homeowner-energy-upgrades/">energy poverty</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/waste/ship-to-shore/">Fisher engagement</a> in ocean literacy and stewardship.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also interested in learning about other methods of supporting local and national targets, including climate finance, climate policy, adaptation strategies, municipal leadership and micro-financing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know how important it is to tackle climate change. It’s affecting animals, wild spaces, communities and even the economy. That’s why the upcoming Global Climate Conference is a critical opportunity for the world to come together to chart a new path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe it’s vital to involve as many young people as we can. We know they care about the Earth and their communities. We also know that given the chance, they have strong opinions and clear ideas about how to fix the problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be a very important Global Climate Conference in Paris from November 30th to December 11th. Canada and almost 200 other countries, as well as thousands of organizations, will work to adopt a universal agreement to limit global emissions production and help societies transition to low-carbon economies. It will be one of the biggest international summits ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean Foundation is providing <a href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/youth-engagement/talking-climate-change-with-kids/">climate change resources to equip elementary-level educators</a> with information and activities that can be easily integrated into their daily lessons. We hope this will help teachers involve students and promote discussion about the important negotiations in Paris that will have a direct impact on their futures.</p>

And with climate change models showing our region will experience storms of increasing severity in coming years, Clean Foundation wants to help mitigate some of the problem associated with all this water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The non-profit organization is launching a three-year Atlantic Stormwater Initiative to help people in the region adapt to climate change, as well as improve the health and long-term sustainability of the Atlantic ecosystem through better stormwater management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A November 9<sup>th</sup> one-day conference will be the kick-off event for the Atlantic Stormwater Initiative. Attending will be urban developers, government officials, NGOs and First Nations groups.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stormwater, also known as ‘runoff’, is the water that runs over surfaces like roads, buildings and agricultural land instead of seeping into the ground. This runoff can accumulate quickly and cause flooding and erosion. It also picks up pollutants and debris, and runs into our streams, rivers and lakes untreated. Conventional stormwater management channels excess water into storm drains and sewers as quickly as possible, leading to overflowing systems and water contamination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Atlantic Stormwater Initiative has been developed by Clean to better manage water quantity and flow, while mitigating the associated impacts to water quality, habitat and biodiversity. This project will improve the capacity of communities to lessen stormwater risks and threats due to climate change, and better protect water quality, habitat and biodiversity. The project will bring together experts and stakeholders throughout Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Newfoundland &amp; Labrador to address stormwater-related impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this project, Clean will support the design and installation of effective demonstration sites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean has received close to $200,000 for the project through Environment Canada’s Atlantic Ecosystem Initiatives. Clean’s Atlantic Stormwater Initiative is also supported by the City of Charlottetown, Halifax Water, CBCL, and TD Friends of the Environment Fund.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>Forty-nine students are working on various environmental projects for nine weeks with community partner groups from Yarmouth to Cheticamp and many points in-between. They join nine Aboriginal Leadership students who have been working since early May. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The summer jobs range from watershed restoration to waste reduction, bat monitoring to eco-tourism, renewable energy to sustainable transportation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of June, all students participated in a training camp in Debert where they had the opportunity to gain valuable knowledge on topics such as entrepreneurship, environmental stewardship, communications and networking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nova Scotia Youth Conservation Corps (NSYCC) was established in 1989 by the Province of Nova Scotia – Clean Foundation has been delivering NSYCC on behalf of Nova Scotia Environment since September 2011.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The goal of the program is to provide Nova Scotia’s youth, aged 15-30, with training and employment opportunities within the environmental field, while providing services to communities in Nova Scotia for the betterment of the local environment. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nova Scotia Youth Conservation Corps (NSYCC) builds connections between youth and local organizations to stimulate stewardship for the natural environment and support the emergence of young community leaders. This is accomplished by providing students with training and employment opportunities through paid work placements with community-based organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another NSYCC priority is to equip youth with the aptitude to become leaders in their communities while delivering meaningful environmental projects across the province.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>The Clean Foundation has partnered with the Halifax Blue Nose Marathon for the second year. We are helping them make the event more environmentally responsible</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the marathon has switched from water bottles to using hydrants for the water stations. Halifax Transit is offering all registrants with a race bib free bus and ferry service on race day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean volunteers will help maintain recycling bins, and our hybrid cars will be used by Blue Nose representatives during the event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And our Clean Foundation bike valet service will return. Located in the Grand Parade Square, free bike storage will be available Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>Congratulations to Jill McSweeney, an Interdisciplinary PhD Candidate with Dalhousie University and recipient of this year’s Clean Postgraduate Research Scholarship.</strong> Jill receives $2,000 to contribute to her research expenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am very honoured that the Clean Foundation found my research deserving of the scholarship!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jill’s research focuses on understanding the human-nature relationship, and how engaging in nature can benefit us physically, psychologically, socially and spiritually. “I am currently investigating how nature exposure directly impacts stress, mood, and altruistic behaviour, and how engaging with nature can foster a sense of connection and relatedness with our environment.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goals of her research are both to better understand how to improve the health and wellbeing of our communities, and to increase environmental awareness in the participants to change these individuals’ perceptiveness and feelings toward the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean hopes to draw upon Jill’s research in our quest to inspire the individual actions that add up to positive environmental change.</p>

              <h3 class="title"><a href="#"><span>Earth Day could also be Green Jobs Day - a message from the Clean Foundation</span></a></h3>
              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p>Today is Earth Day, a day to reflect on the environment, and on how we can lesson our impact on the natural world that sustain us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for too many in our province, it’s also ‘try to find a job’ day or ‘watch your child move out west’ day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stats are alarming. A shrinking population and tax base. A stagnant economy. Traditional industries in decline. Rural towns decorated with out-of-business signs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These stats have a human face. Sons and daughters going down the road because of a lack of employment. First Nations’ youth not offered the chance to unlock their potential. Immigrants not finding opportunity here so they continue their journey elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve heard the warnings of the One Nova Scotia Commission – change our way of thinking, and do it now or never because soon it will be too late. Nova Scotia needs entrepreneurs and business start-ups. We need revenue to maintain our schools and our hospitals. We need a deeply welcoming society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an environmental organization with over 25 years of experience, the Clean Foundation also knows we need to better manage our natural resources. We need to clean up our waterways, and reduce our waste. And most of all, we need to confront the realities of climate change, to help stave off the devastating consequences of too many greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those stats are also alarming, and they too have a human face. There are economic and social costs to climate change that we – and our children and grandchildren – will pay, one way or another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we chart a course to the new economy, let’s also tackle the challenge of climate change. We <i>can</i> use economic levers to create incentives for industries to transition away from fossil fuels. We <i>can</i> create the green collar jobs that keep future generations believing that this future is possible here. We <i>can</i> create the healthy environment and vibrant society that attracts newcomers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we have to take risks, be creative, and engage in smart and bold conversations that are not immediately dispersed by the prism of politics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In practice, this means a moratorium on shale gas fracking is not the end of a debate, but another chapter in an ongoing discourse about energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means adding value to our natural resources. It means taxing the bad stuff – pollution and greenhouse gases – instead of just the good stuff like jobs and wages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s time for our province to move beyond the ‘versus’ economy. Jobs vs the environment. City vs countryside. Nova Scotians vs come-from-aways.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need a strong equitable economy that is rooted in a healthy environment. We know it won’t be easy. But we’ve been innovators before. Nova Scotia led the way with a system that diverted 50 percent of waste from our landfills. A quarter of our electricity will come from renewables by the end of this year, and over 40 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And we’ve become a leader in energy efficiency. For our part, the Clean Foundation has helped prevent 110,000 tons of greenhouse gases from being released into the atmosphere. That’s equivalent to removing the annual energy consumption of over 14,000 homes from Nova Scotia’s electricity grid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Energy efficiency not only saves money and reduces our carbon footprint, it also supports local businesses doing this work – a green industry that will continue to grow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is now more employment in Canada’s clean energy sector than in the oil sands. That’s the future. That’s jobs <i>and</i> the environment.</p>

              <h3 class="title"><a href="#"><span>The Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up litter campaign now welcoming team registrations</span></a></h3>
              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p><strong>The Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up – Nova Scotia’s largest litter reduction initiative – launches this spring.</strong> Registrations are now open for teams across the province at <a title="Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up" href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/waste/great-nova-scotia-pick-me-up/" target="_blank">www.nspickmeup.ca</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spring weather will eventually arrive, and with it the litter and garbage underneath all that melting snow. After a particularly long winter and an unprecedented amount of snow, litter will make an unsightly appearance as never before. The Clean Foundation has a solution and is inviting all Nova Scotians (families, youth, individuals, businesses and schools) to take part in the Great Pick-Me-Up, our long-standing anti-litter program and one of the largest volunteer initiatives in the province.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With support from municipalities, Clean will provide teams with everything they need to run a successful litter clean-up event. Groups can register by calling (902) 420-3474 or by going online at <a title="Great Nova Scotia Pick-Me-Up" href="http://clean.ns.ca/programs/waste/great-nova-scotia-pick-me-up/" target="_blank">nspickmeup.ca</a>. Clean will send a free kit that includes supplies, information on how to coordinate your event and a data card to track results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Litter is an eyesore, poses health risks, affects water quality, and is often mistaken as food for wildlife. Studies show people tend to litter in areas where there is already garbage on the ground. That’s why Clean wants Nova Scotians to pick it up and promote clean communities this spring – and throughout the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Clean is proud to facilitate litter clean-ups. It brings groups and individuals together and helps them improve the quality of life in their communities, while also helping the local environment,”  says Chris Morrissey, Clean Foundation’s Executive Director.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean is encouraging teams to post ‘before &amp; after’ photos of their pick-me-up locations and post to social media using the hashtag <strong>#GladToCleanUp.</strong></p>

              <div class="content" style="display: none;"><p>Halifax Harbour is a functioning estuary that shelters numerous fisheries that are of recreational, commercial and aboriginal importance, including Gaspereau, American eel and Atlantic salmon. The rivers that flow into the harbour are essential watercourses for fish to access freshwater spawning grounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sawmill River, in downtown Dartmouth, is one such river that connects Halifax Harbour to some of the largest water bodies in the Dartmouth area. Forty-three years ago, a 700 meter length of the Sawmill River was buried in a pipe underground, creating a barrier that prevents fish from moving to their essential spawning grounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The barrier of the Sawmill River remains to this day. The Halifax Water Commission will soon be replacing this underground pipe along the length of the Sawmill River to accommodate elevated precipitation loads due to climate change. In this replacement, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans is requiring that fish passage be restored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A variety of environmental, aboriginal and recreational organizations and local businesses are encouraging the city and the water commission to “daylight” the Sawmill River to bring economic, environmental, recreational, and social benefits to the community of Dartmouth.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daylighting describes projects that deliberately expose some or all of the flow of a previously covered river, creek, or stormwater drainage. Daylighting of the Sawmill River will also complement the extensive work and investment of the City of Halifax to clean up the Harbour through improved sewage treatment in recent years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean Foundation has worked to restore adjacent watersheds such as the Cow Bay River, Little Salmon River, Smelt Run, Hornes Brook, and Gammon Lake Brook since 2006. Our watershed restoration team has developed expertise in watershed restoration and community engagement, stewardship and education about the benefits and requirements for healthy watercourses. The Sawmill River is literally in Clean Foundation’s backyard, and we see the value in daylighting this river, as it should be greatly beneficial to the fish that reside in Dartmouth area watercourses, Halifax Harbour and the Atlantic Ocean, while bringing urban renewal by bringing water and nature back into the heart of the city, and provide an excellent opportunity for community education and outreach in the benefits and services of clean and restored watersheds.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Clean Foundation supports the initiative to daylight the Sawmill River and commits to assisting the city of Halifax and Halifax Water Commission in maintaining exposed sections of the river.</strong>  Maintenance support from Clean Foundation could include habitat restoration, erosion control, debris clearing and removal and litter clean ups.</p>
