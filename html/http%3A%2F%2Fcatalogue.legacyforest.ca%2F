				 is a wilderness park located in Northwestern Ontario, Canada.  Ontario Parks
				define wilderness parks as:  "...substantial areas where the forces of nature
				are permitted to function freely and where visitors travel by non-mechanized
				means and experience expansive solitude, challenge and personal integration
				with nature."  People come to Quetico Park to enjoy life at an easier pace,
				visit the Library or to canoe the vast network of rivers and lakes.

				the library was to serve anyone with an interest in Quetico Park and environs,
				its history, resources, and the preservation and management of its wilderness
				and the lands around it.  The Library assists in the preservation of the
				cultural and natural heritage of Quetico Park through various programs like
