Some of the collection object graphics were originally 35mm photographs taken by G. Hagey in the 1980s, and subsequently edited by E.M. Avedon. Additional digital photographs were taken by E.M. Avedon and Museum personnel or are edited copies from a wide range of sources. Some of the HTML code used for these Web pages was developed by T.O. Stewart.">

<p>The colorful carved wooden whale <em>above </em>is a game.
  You can CLICK on the whale to view detailed photographs of the components of this game,  discover how this game is played, who played it, where it was played, and find out about the artist who created the components of the game. This is an example of the many types of information about GAMES that will be found on this Website.</p>
<h3>The Sources for Webpage Information</h3> 
<p>In 1971, the <em>Universiy of Waterloo</em> in Ontario, Canada established a public museum dedicated to research and the collection, preservation, and exhibition of games and game-related objects from around the world. The Museum was established and operated by the <em>Department of Recreation and Leisure Studies,</em> under the administration of the <em>Faculty of Applied Health Sciences</em>. </p>
<p>There were over 5000 objects in the collection, and a large number of archival documents about games. Public thematic exhibitions were offered in an on-campus venue. The University closed this museum in 2009 and its collection was transferred to the Canadian&nbsp;<strong>Museum of Civilization</strong>, one of the <em>Canadian National Museums</em> in Ottawa. A wider public will now be able to view and conduct research on the collection. With this transfer, the collection will now be conserved for many generations to come.</p>
<p>In 1993, the Univesity began to offer the public this  Website based upon the materials in the Museum. Even though the Museum no longer exists, but the collection does, the University decided to continue to host this Website about games as an educational service to the public.
  On over 700 Webpages, the site includes videos, photographs, diagrams, other graphics, and textual information about games. </p>
