<p><span style="color: #000000;">We are deeply saddened by the fires of Fort McMurray. We cannot begin to imagine the stress and panic that many must be feeling as they sit helplessly watching these unfolding events. We are also mindful of the exhaustion firefighters on the front lines must be feeling. Our prayers are clearly with everyone facing these challenges. May God&rsquo;s strength uphold all those seeking to cope with this tragedy and may the desperately needed rains come quickly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Introducing our 2016 Convocation Keynote Speaker</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Richard-Topping.jpg"/>

<p>The following article has been written by The Reverend Dr. Jason Byassee, inaugural Butler Chair of Homiletics and Biblical Hermeneutics &ndash; a reflection on his friend&nbsp;and colleague, The Reverend Dr. Lillian Daniel, our speaker for Convocation this year. Lillian Daniel will also be leading a workshop entitled &lsquo;Religion without Ranting, Spirituality without Stereotypes&rsquo;, sponsored by the Hugh and Helen Mogenson Fund for Church Revitalization.</p>
<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know those moments in life when disparate pieces come together? Say, at a graduation, or a wedding, or a funeral, when you find yourself introducing your great aunt to your high school friends, or your cousins to your boss? Things come together in surprising ways and you start to think the universe might be, well, connected.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like that for me introducing my friend Lillian Daniel to the VST community.</p>
<p>Lillian and I were neighbours in Chicagoland and got to know one another&rsquo;s families and ministries. She was pastoring a thriving United Church of Christ congregation in the wealthy suburb of Glen Ellyn while I was working at <em>Christian Century. </em>We got to know one another&rsquo;s friends and contacts and found ourselves competing to find the coolest, most counter-intuitive friends just to tell the other about it (&lsquo;I met the bible church pastor here!&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh yeah? Well I got published in <em>Books &amp; Culture</em>!&rsquo;). We both taught in seminaries around Chicago and challenged one another to start our book-writing careers. And then after we kept in touch with conferences where we both spoke at events (me always the undercard) in places like Princeton, Duke, New Hampshire, Guemes Island, and Grand Rapids. I&rsquo;m eager to see what she&rsquo;ll become now as the brand new senior minister at First Congregational UCC in Dubuque Iowa.</p>
<p>Now I get to introduce her here. Since we both started out Lillian has become a big deal. She&rsquo;s gotten to lecture in Australia, England, and even exotic Canada. She&rsquo;s preached at Riverside Church, Duke Chapel, the Festival of Homiletics, and the National Cathedral. Her book on testimony described the way UCC congregations need to reacquaint themselves with their New England Puritan tradition of inviting lay people to testify about their faith to the congregation. We ministers need not stand in the way of different parts of Christ&rsquo;s body sharing the warm bread of vibrant faith with their hungry friends. Her book with Martin Copenhaver, <em>This Odd and Wondrous Calling</em>, responded to the rash of books dissing the local church by showing that life with an ordinary congregation of believers is so much more interesting than life with people who think just like us. And her book <em>When &ldquo;Spiritual But Not Religious&rdquo; Is Not Enough</em> threw down a gauntlet at the SBNR phenomenon. I love her snarky response to the chattering know-it-all on the plane who likes to patronize us religious professionals on airplanes and at parties by saying how they find God in nature or in their kid&rsquo;s genius or in email forwards: &ldquo;Please stop boring me.&rdquo; And she offers this riposte to our mainline tendency to apologize for everything every vile person ever did in the name of Christianity: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done apologizing for a church I don&rsquo;t belong to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lillian is wickedly funny (can you tell?). She&rsquo;s also wise. And she&rsquo;s willing to speak in devotional terms not just about God, but about Jesus. And not just about Jesus, but about Jesus&rsquo; beloved church, filled with ordinary self-important know-it-alls like us. If there is anything boring it is ourselves. And if there is anyone interesting it is the triune God who loves us unimaginably. Reading Lillian makes me want to love and serve God more.</p>
<p>Lillian contributed an essay to a book on Eugene Peterson that I co-edited. She said there that Peterson&rsquo;s work gave her a sort of permission: she could be a writer as a pastor. She didn&rsquo;t need anything more glamorous or pretentious than a pulpit to take up a pen. She didn&rsquo;t need a Ph.D., an academic appointment, or to have grown a megachurch to have something to say. As a preacher she knows how to stand between God and God&rsquo;s people and God&rsquo;s word and offer words as a gift from one to the other. That&rsquo;s all good writing it.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s right&mdash;and you don&rsquo;t need anything more to write either, gentle reader.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted she&rsquo;ll be here for our convocation and for the followup workshop on church vitality. I&rsquo;m confident your ministry will not be the same after you&rsquo;ve spent some time with her. You won&rsquo;t just come away saying how cool she is (though she is that). You&rsquo;ll come away saying how cool God is, and how cool you are, and what a privilege this ecclesial life we share is of getting to serve God and God&rsquo;s people.</p>

<p><em>The following article appeared in the Spring 2015 issue of VST&rsquo;s biannual magazine, Perspectives.</em></p>
<hr><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Rabbi Laura Duhan Kaplan</i></b><i> reflects on her experience of living into her Jewish identity as a faculty member of an ecumenical Christian graduate school&hellip;</i></p>
<p>Recently, a new artisan storefront opened near my Main Street home. As I like to support local artisans, I wandered in for a look. &ldquo;Our name is <b>Just Jewellery</b>,&rdquo; said the salesperson. &ldquo;We specialize in silver and semiprecious stones, featuring the work of several local artists&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I could not focus on her words. Instead, images of divinity overwhelmed me. I saw <b>Ganesh</b>, Hindu god of wisdom, carved in jade;<b> Buddha</b>, sculpted in a granite-like paste; a<b> Kabbalistic</b> network of triangles drawn with sparkles; a <b>Cross </b>embellished with garnet; a bold <b>Eagle</b>, etched in silver.</p>
<p>This store was a festival, but I was not sure what kind. A deeply multi-faith festival, celebrating devotional artistic intent? Or a superficial spiritual-not-religious marketplace, baiting buyers with aesthetic beauty?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, take a closer look at something,&rdquo; the seller begged, &ldquo;Even if you don&rsquo;t want to buy today!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Focusing, I asked to see four pendants: a doubled <i>magen david </i>(<b>Star of David</b>), a flowing <b>Sanskrit Om</b>, <b>St. Christopher</b> carrying a child, and a tree with roots in earth and heaven. The heavy garnet cross intrigued me, too; but I did not ask to see it. I could not imagine touching it.</p>
<p>Was this Christian symbol too sacred for me, or too terrifying?</p>
<p>Every Thursday at<b> </b>VST Community Worship, I ask myself a similar question.</p>
<p>I love our community worship. No two weeks are quite the same. Faculty sparkle; students experiment; everyone sings, whether they know the tune or not. We learn from one another about denominational worship styles, creative preaching, presence in leadership and more. Sometimes I participate, chanting Hebrew scripture or offering a Jewish prayer. No one minds that I never take communion and rarely say &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen&rdquo; should be simple, but for me it is not. Every time I hear the name of<b> Jesus</b> or his spiritual title &ldquo;<b>Christ&rdquo;</b> used in worship,<br>
I startle.</p>
<p>This agitation does not come over me in class, or in meetings, conversations, or lectures&mdash;only at worship.</p>
<p>My reaction surprises and worries me. Perhaps it should not. <b>Pastor Don MacKenzie, Rabbi Ted Falcon, </b>and <b>Imam Jamal Rahman</b>&mdash;the team-teaching and co-writing <b>&ldquo;Interfaith Amigos&rdquo; </b>&mdash;list five stages of deepening interfaith dialogue. The fifth and most challenging stage is &ldquo;exploring spiritual practices from<br>
other traditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But should I not have reached that stage? For forty years, I have gathered multi-faith knowledge, and pursued a spiritual formation beyond borders. Avoiding the superficial, I have earned degrees, diplomas and certificates from credible academic and professional programs. Western philosophy, Ayurvedic yoga, Kabbalistic Judaism, Christian spiritual direction, and Jungian depth psychology. My studies have led me to an inclusive theology.</p>
<p>God is, as <b>Matthew Fox</b> might say, the &ldquo;<b>one river</b>&rdquo; of spirit, bubbling up in &ldquo;many wells&rdquo; of tradition.</p>
<p>God is, in Kabbalistic Hebrew, <b>Eyn Sof</b>, Infinity. All human expressions of spirituality circle within the Infinite God. Every religious word, concept, sound, or ritual may turn us towards God, but cannot fully encompass the divine.</p>
<p>God is, as depth psychologists say, &ldquo;<b>psyche</b>&rdquo;&mdash;a totality of all possible experiences and influences. Psyche surrounds us, appearing to us as consciousness, while also directing us beyond consciousness.</p>
<p>God is, as I learned in yoga, <b>Brahman</b>, infinite energy, mirrored in atman, the individual soul.</p>
<p>Yet, when I startle at Jesus&rsquo; name, my seamlessly inclusive theology begins to crack.</p>
<p>As it should! Because, as it admits, even it is a partial representation. Unchallenged, it could harden into a kind of armour. Wearing it, I could fend off all new ideas. At best, new ideas would be pale reflections of what I already know.<br>
At worst, they would be childish and concrete compared with my grand vision. And this posture, says <b>Vine DeLoria</b>, is theology&rsquo;s contribution to North America&rsquo;s dismissal of Indigenous people.</p>
<p>When I attend community worship at VST, I try not to wear my deep ecumenism as armour.</p>
<p>Taking off the armour, though, leaves me vulnerable. And a memory of an early encounter with Christianity bubbles up. A troubling encounter set against a previously positive backdrop of our neighbours&rsquo; Christmas candies, gifts, and smiles.</p>
<p>My friend Mary and I are five or six years old. Our athletic mothers, off doing their sports, have left us to play at the community centre. We are each allowed one chocolate drink, so we are standing by the cooler, choosing.</p>
<p>Suddenly Mary says, &ldquo;The Jews killed Jesus Christ, you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; I retort without a second&rsquo;s pause. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know who he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, please do laugh at Mary&rsquo;s childish audacity, and my childish egocentrism. Surely our mothers would have laughed, too, amid their mutual embarrassment and apologies.</p>
<p>And please do cry at the cruel power of memory. Because every Thursday at VST, I expect some monstrous grownup form of Mary to leap up and accuse me. And sometimes&mdash;even amid my euphoric enjoyment&mdash;I want to run from the room.</p>
<p>Of course, at thoughtful, engaged, and generous VST, no one accuses me. And I do not run from the room. Instead, I assume the posture of a good participant observer. I practice what <b>Paul Ricouer</b> would call a &ldquo;hermeneutic of recollection&rdquo;&mdash;an expectation that I will collect meaning. I listen to the words, feel the energy in the room, look others in the eye as we pass the peace, and feel my students&rsquo; nervousness as they learn to lead.<br>
I wait, hoping to learn what &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; mean to them. Not the conceptual understanding expressed in class discussion and writing, but the energy that stirs their hearts to risk-taking, tears, euphoria, and a sense of peace.</p>
<p>What I learn overflows even my inclusive theology. Particularity is important, too. Sure, some students experience Christ as a reminder of cosmic consciousness, beyond the physical form of any dogma. Others experience Jesus as an exemplary crusader for justice. Or a paradoxical teacher, stimulating radical insight. Someone willing to humble himself for the good of others. An exemplar, showing how every human being can embody God&rsquo;s presence. A unique historical person, whose life story made new religious insight possible. Jesus Christ the symbol overflows categorization, appealing to abstract and concrete thinkers alike.</p>
<p>These data are a beginning, anyway. The insights do not erase my discomfort, but they do help me live into it and learn from it.</p>
<p>Perhaps the artisan&rsquo;s garnet-studded cross was too terrifying for me to touch. The cross brought little Mary&rsquo;s faux pas to mind. It reminded me that outside VST and a small circle of fellow travellers, the inter-religious world is still deeply troubled. To some, my Jewish existence is a threat; others feel threatened by Christians, Muslims, or Hindus.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the garnet cross evoked so much meaning, it was too sacred to touch casually. The cross is not, and never will be, my own religious symbol. But I can no longer approach it as a tourist. The cross is a portal to a complex network of spiritual understanding, new, exciting, educational.</p>
<p>The artisan store, I think, was both superficially beautiful and deeply multi-faith. It all depends on how you shop.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">VST announces major funding from The United Church of Canada</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Tugboat_in_front_of_North_Vancouver.jpg"/>

<p>With gratitude, Vancouver School of Theology is delighted to be the recipient of $500,000, a portion of the assets generated by the recent disbandment and subsequent sale of the Capilano United Church. For VST, this catalyst gift will initiate the creation of a designated fund that will financially support a robust United Church of Canada presence in the faculty and program of the school.</p>
<p>The decision to distribute these funds to VST involved former members of the congregation, Vancouver-Burrard Presbytery, and BC Conference.</p>
<p>VST would also like to acknowledge that the national United Church has recently restored funding in support of a United Church faculty position at VST, which further strengthens the ability of VST to provide denominational training to its United Church students.</p>
<p>VST is grateful for the ongoing support of The United Church of Canada for these significant contributions, as we strive to form and educate thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian leaders for the church in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Remarks at Opening of VST Building, November 14, 2015</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Richard-Topping.jpg"/>

<p>It is outstanding to be the Principal of a school that has its own address. We are in our new building, and we are glad. Our school &ndash; it&rsquo;s students, teachers, staff &ndash; were without a home and now we have a home in this lovely, gorgeous building. It is delightful to have classrooms and worship space and offices and furniture and file cabinets. We were guests and pilgrims for the past year, and now we have arrived in an outstanding new building.</p>
<p>When we announced in chapel that we had occupancy of this building just about 6 weeks ago in chapel (and my, what an important word occupancy is), there was clapping and cheers and amens! from our students. Even the Presbyterians got emotional!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope fulfilled makes the heart sad, but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life,&rdquo; say the scriptures. Our hope was deferred, a few times, but now longing is fulfilled and we&rsquo;ve got the tree of life &ndash; right there in our trinity cross (an architectural feature on the outside of our building).</p>
<p>And yet, while the building is complete and occupied, it is valuable to us because of what we can do in it. Our vision, our calling is &lsquo;to educate and form thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian leaders.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This blessed place on Walter Gage Road is a locale for promise keeping. It is a place where significant and weighty matters take place. Lives are changed here through encounters with people and texts and teachers and scriptures. Learning is a brave endeavor if you do it right; it involves what John Calvin called a &lsquo;teachable spirit.&rsquo; That means laying your life open to <strong>God</strong> knows what, to listening and meditating and lingering, to welcoming otherness into your life. All of that means you will be changed. Our hope and prayer is that this building becomes a place where people are porous to scripture and scholarship and example and pain and joy and most of all to the Holy Spirit so that no one leaves the way they came. We don&rsquo;t just want to lay out a few principals for people to consider at a dispassionate clinical distance, we are looking to form lives for service and ministry in this world to which God sent Jesus Christ. We are not doing safe autopsies on dead letters, we&rsquo;re engaging with the living Word that challenges and changes and renews. We are a <strong><em>theo</em>&nbsp;</strong>logical college.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s why I chose to read the short piece form the book of Romans for today. <em>(Romans 12:9-19)&nbsp;</em>The text is a description of the practice of faith. It is one thing to have theoretical commitments to a matter, and another to let the matter shape you, seep into your life. That&rsquo;s why our vision includes both education and formation . . . We want to teach content and creed that gets life-giving traction in the world. Minds renewed by the content of faith gives birth to hearts and hands that engage the world. &lsquo;Love with affection, rejoice in hope, persevere in prayer, contribute to needs of others, extend hospitality.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s not normal. It takes an encounter with God to get to a life like that.</p>
<p>Formation for leadership is ambitious work. It is about more than techniques for success, managerial tips, and tricks; it is about character-transformation, summoning up an eccentric life of witness to the love of God for every person. It is our calling to form leaders like that. That&rsquo;s why we open our classes with prayer at VST. It is why we promise and then pray on a day like today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I planned to stop right there. But today we hear the words of our bible reading with different ears, &lsquo;bless those who persecute you and weep those who weep . . . do not repay any one evil for evil . . . so far as it depends on you live peaceable with all . . .&rsquo; And we pray for the people of France, of Paris, where they weep, asking that that God would console them and that God&rsquo;s world would be saved from tit-for-tat retaliation, from violence that begets violence. Friends, the work of peaceable &lsquo;theological <strong>formation</strong>&rsquo; matters a great deal for the world right now. I invite you to pray with me . . .</p>
<p>God of peace,</p>
<p>we pray for the people of Paris, France:<br>
may your peace break through violence,<br>
may your love conquer fear,<br>
may your justice prevail</p>
<p>may your mercy console and comfort; through Jesus Christ</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<hr><h2>Principal Report to Chancellor&rsquo;s Dinner 2015</h2>
<p>Welcome. I speak to you this evening as an incredibly happy, (relieved) and grateful principal of the Vancouver School of Theology.</p>
<p>Thank you all for sharing in this delightful annual event and for your partnership with our school in the work of theological education.</p>
<p>Thank you to all who have made this evening possible &ndash; David McMillan, Shannon Lythgoe and Lisa Wittman of our advancement department have done excellent work for this evening.</p>
<p>A special thanks on this occasion to our board, and to the Property Management Team in particular for their expertise, their wise and prudent planning and oversight. We are now in our new school building. We hope it will be the epicenter for the education and formation of thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian leaders.</p>
<p>I am especially grateful to the chair of our board, Mr. Michael Francis for his perpetual calm and wise advice and for his unflagging encouragement to us all through this past year and a half of transition. Michael is relentlessly positive.</p>
<p>Thanks also to the Deans (past and present) of St Andrew&rsquo;s Hall (and to their board), who may well be here this evening to be sure that we have moved out. We came for a year at SAH, and like weird uncle Bill at Christmas, stayed a while longer than expected; and you were constantly hospitable and understanding. Jesus said, &lsquo;I was a stranger and you welcomed me;&rsquo; somehow that seems less remarkable than &lsquo;we weren&rsquo;t strangers and you still welcomed us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To all the VST staff and faculty, your perpetually &lsquo;we can do this attitude&rsquo; and your resourcefulness in transition was inspiring. What a joy to get settled into our beautiful new home where we inform, form and transform students who will make a difference in the world God loves.</p>
<p>Six years ago, I came to theological education from pastoral ministry in downtown Montreal. I did so because I felt summoned to the ministry of theological education for the church. I love the church in its multiple forms; in its spirit-inspired variety; in its acts of beauty, love and mercy for the world. Pope Francis has shown how mercy moves the world. You can get young people from Houston to sleep on the streets of Philadelphia just to catch a glimpse of mercy. I have known the church as an agent of God&rsquo;s mercy in my own life and in the lives of others.</p>
<p>VST has just moved into a purpose build facility on the campus of UBC, in the heart of the theological neighbourhood. We have a new infusion of energy, wisdom and experience. We have a cadre of professors who come to us from transformative congregational ministry, and it is changing us.</p>
<p>We believe we have a unique place in the world of theological education in Canada and North America. Church leaders across North America say that here on the left coast we are where they will be. They want to know: what kind of witness and work can VST inspire in its graduates for the sake of God&rsquo;s people and the world in a predominately secular situation, because that&rsquo;s where they are headed too.</p>
<p>All the recent changes in our school &ndash; faculty and facilities &ndash; are designed to answer this question. Our vision, our calling, is to educate and form thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian leaders for this time and place.</p>
<p>We want our graduates to be thoughtful people, reflective about how to interact with the wide range of challenges of our time on the basis of the deep resources of faith. We don&rsquo;t rush to thin relevance, but linger with scripture, tradition and scholarship to expand our sense of the way the world could be, might be, should be. We believe that to go deep with the triune God in spiritual formation and education results in Christian leaders that go wide in their embrace, interest and care for the world God has visited. Doug Hall, United Church Theologian says, &lsquo;to study Christian faith is to enter a conversation that has been going on for a long time, and we need to listen before we rush in with instant wisdom and six-minute sermonettes.&rsquo; In a world where folks snorkel near the surface for a passing acquaintance, we&rsquo;ve interest in diving down deep to encounter and transformation.</p>
<p>Maybe another way to put it is this: in theological education we are trying to make preparing for ministry in the name of Jesus as difficult as it ought to be. I have thought a great deal about why ministry is so hard &ndash; secularity, post-Christendom, multi-culturalism, shrinking church, opportunities to golf. My friend Will Willimon has persuaded me, however, that it is Jesus&rsquo; fault. He is really hard to follow &ndash; I mean &lsquo;pray for your enemies, bless those who curse you.&rsquo; It is hard to get formed by that for life. But as Tom Hanks, baseball coach in the Movie, A League of Their Own said, &ldquo;If baseball was easy then everyone would do it.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the same with theological education.</p>
<p>We want our graduates to be engaged people; folks willing to get involved in this world, not just wait for the next. We want to get dirt under our nails, gain some traction in the soil of this good earth, not just contemplate creation from an antiseptic, safe distance. Our theological ethos is designed to nurture practioners who are making a difference in the world for God and the gospel. It is in the DNA of VST to get involved in the big challenges the world faces. &nbsp;Convinced that God is already always at work in the world, we discern that movement and try to go with the flow of grace in the world &ndash; wherever we find it. And wow, it is spectacularly wonderful and surprising where it finds us. We think that &lsquo;mainline churches, who want to be a part of God&rsquo;s future need leadership by impatient instigators rather than patient caretakers of the status quo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We want our graduates to be generous people, able to find friends &ndash; across denominations, faith traditions and cultural differences &ndash; with whom to collaborate for the love of God and the good of creation. Built into our school, our curriculum, we collaborate with folks of other faiths and our First Nations friends, for the sake of friendship, transformative learning and human fullness. We&rsquo;re working at cooperation with Sauder School of business to teach our graduates how to lead in faith based organizations. We are collaborating with synagogue and church on sponsoring a Syrian refugee. The root of our generosity, our respect and openness to others, is our baptismal identity in Christ, who calls us to love our neighbour unconditionally, to learn from our neighbours without fear and to act with and for others for the sake of the world. The Triune God, who is a beloved community &ndash; Father, Son and Holy Spirit &ndash; inspires the VST ethos of hospitality and welcome to the other.</p>
<p>Last year with our new students we sat around at the beginning of the semester and asked them, &lsquo;how&rsquo;d you get here?&rsquo; Wow! That was interesting. I listened to call stories &ndash; students jerked out of perfectly good careers to come and study theology, bright young people shoved into a very different direction, a woman who came to VST because of a dream! I sat there thinking, what a trust we have; these folks have pushed their chips to the centre of the table, they are all in.</p>
<p>Our promise at VST is to keep that trust. It is our calling to form and educate students who will be thoughtful, engaged and generous leaders in this time and place. And with your help, we will keep our promise.</p>
<p>I want to introduce you now to a three of our new professors. It will be a short interview &ndash; two questions and 7 minutes:</p>
<p>Question number 1: What brought you to VST?</p>
<p>What are your hopes for the school?</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Dying to Lead</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Richard-Topping.jpg"/>

<p><span class="s1">Principal Richard Topping was the preacher on Sunday August 9, 2015 at Fairview Presbyterian Church, Vancouver, on the occasion of the ordination of Curtis and Elaine Wilson to the ministry of Word and Sacrament in the Presbyterian Church.&nbsp; Curtis graduated from VST in May of 2015 and Elaine, our top ministry graduate, in May of 2014. &nbsp;The Wilson&rsquo;s will take up the work of congregational ministry in Kingston Ontario.&nbsp; The sermon is entitled: <em>Dying to Lead</em> and is a reflection on the temptations of leadership and their remedies.</span></p>
<h3>Dying to Lead</h3>
<h3>Mark 9:30-41, Mark 10:32-45</h3>
<p>It is an utter delight to offer the sermon at the service of ordination for Curtis and Elaine Wilson, two wonderful people, committed Christians and diligent students.</p>
<p>Many people are here today &ndash; their parents and pastors and teachers, mentors and friends &ndash; who have shared in their formation, people whom the risen Christ has used to shape their lives for ministry. Thank you Church of Jesus Christ. Today we acknowledge the way the Spirit has already ordered the church in the gifts given to those two friends for service to God and the Gospel. Thanks be to God!</p>
<p>The topic of my sermon is leadership. Leadership comes up in our lessons from Mark (chapter 10). This is one of the rare places in the Bible where Jesus gets involved with his followers about leadership style (katexousiazousin &ndash; the contemporary English Bible translates the word &ndash; leadership, in Mark 10 and in Matthew 25).</p>
<p>Like most of the Bible on the theme, Jesus comes at it from the side. At one and the same time, Mark has Jesus teaching us about the temptations of leadership and what leading looks like when it is Jesus inspired and Spirit fired. I want to look at 3 temptations for leaders and then their remedies.</p>
<p>1: The Temptation to forget only Jesus presence makes ministry work.</p>
<p>Just before the place we began in the 9th chapter of Mark, Peter and John and James descend the mountain. They&rsquo;ve come fresh from an experience of God &ndash; lights and voices and prophets at dizzying heights. They all have an epiphany, they see Jesus with the curtain drawn back in his full glory. This spiritually pumped up inner group comes down to the &lsquo;real&rsquo; world with Jesus.</p>
<p>They come way down to a religious argument. It is actually an attempt to rationalize failure. The topic seems to have something to do with demons, and how best to be relieved of them. The other nine disciples engage religious authorities about the right words, the correct sequence, the proper alchemy, how to get the exorcism abracadabra to work. The nine disciples in the valley couldn&rsquo;t help a demonized boy. And their failed attempts at ministry turns into a theoretical discussion of formula and process and the right way to do it.</p>
<p>I do that. You know what they say, those who can, do; those who can&rsquo;t teach, or, in this case, fuss about the liturgy.</p>
<p>The crowd abandons the religious debate for Jesus. Mark says, &lsquo;they were immediately overcome with awe&rsquo; at the sight of Jesus. Crowds would still rather meet Jesus than engage in religious argument about the right way to do it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the fuss?,&rsquo; asks Jesus. And a desperate Father speaks up about his demonized son for whom there is no deliverance.</p>
<p>And Jesus loses it; Jesus goes on a rant &ndash; &lsquo;you faithfulness generation, how much longer must I be among you, how much longer must I put up with you?&rsquo; Wow! Jesus seems ready for a premature ascension. The disciples and the crowd stand there for this dressing down. This is no gentle Jesus meek and mild. I wonder if Jesus is just fed up with antiseptic arm&rsquo;s-length religious discussion in the face of genuine human need. Notice they argue about how to get a demon out, and Jesus talks not about formula but faith &ndash; trust, confidence in God and God&rsquo;s only Son, Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus turns to the boy&rsquo;s dad &ndash; &lsquo;Bring him here&rsquo; and the kid is writhing in the gravel. He asks, &lsquo;How long has he been like this?.&rsquo; The boy&rsquo;s dad says from childhood and &lsquo;I know that you&rsquo;re willing to cure him Jesus, but are you able?&rsquo; Jesus says, &ldquo;Able! Have a little faith would you!&rdquo; The situation is starved of faith &ndash; confidence in Jesus as the embodiment of God&rsquo;s good intention for this suffering world. But the boy&rsquo;s dad says, &lsquo;Well I&rsquo;ve got some faith, please give me more.&rsquo; And Jesus, hears these words as a prayer, orders the demon out and helps the boy to his feet.</p>
<p>Once alone with Jesus the disciples say, &lsquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t we do that, Jesus?&rsquo; And Jesus says, &lsquo;It was a tough one &ndash; only prayer and fasting (in some manuscripts) can get that monkey off your back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>You see prayer and fasting are ways in which disciples get clear on whose ministry it is. Prayer is the posture of dependence on Jesus. As Living Faith says, it is not our ministry, &lsquo;all Christians participate in the ministry of Christ.&rsquo; Forget that and all we&rsquo;ve got are tired and boring and tedious discussions about the right way to do it &ndash; alchemy and odd superstition and our defenses of our preferences is all that&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>Jesus then tells the disciples, again, he&rsquo;s going to the cross &ndash; he&rsquo;s going to be handed over, killed and he will rise. He won&rsquo;t just heal this boy but the world! His ministry is one of service to the whole of humanity. He will give his life a ransom for many. He will exorcize God&rsquo;s good creation. The disciples don&rsquo;t know what he&rsquo;s talking about. No one even asks a question &ndash; they are puzzled, bewildered, afraid.</p>
<p>And so the disciples follow a familiar pattern when they are stymied, afraid and defeated: they argue, this time about who is the greatest. They had argued about healing ministry with the religious leaders. The topic this time isn&rsquo;t ministry, but &lsquo;who is the greatest minister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Remember: not one of them was successful in exorcizing the demon possessed boy when Jesus wasn&rsquo;t there. Not one of them could bring life and liberty to a boy troubled from birth. They come fresh from failure, from the experience of their own limitations and of their utter need to participate in Jesus&rsquo; ministry if anything is going to become of theirs and they argue with each other about who is top dog.</p>
<p>Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive of Starbucks wrote an op ed piece for the NY Times this week entitled &ndash; &lsquo;People deserve a servant leader.&rsquo; It is a piece inspired by the example of Pope Francis. Shultz says he remembers that, shortly after his election, Francis knelt and washed the feet of a dozen prisoners in Rome, one of them a Muslim woman. He wrote, &ldquo;I have taken to recalling that humble inspiring act of servant leadership as I observe the antithesis in the field of presidential aspirants . . . &lsquo;</p>
<p>Jesus took a child, and said in the topsy-turvy world that God is bringing if you get down low, get downwardly mobile, on your knees, enter the world of a child &ndash; one without power or even a tinge of greatness as the world counts greatness &ndash; then you will meet me and welcome the one who sent me. And when and where we meet Jesus and welcome him in the ones he is with, we are in ministry, his ministry, and so effective ministry.</p>
<p>I came to visit Martina, who was dying of emphysema. I knew the previous night she had almost died. She told me, &lsquo;I had never felt so alone and desperate as last night. I just felt God forsaken, abandoned, overwhelmed.&rsquo; I stood there thinking, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the thing to say, the right protocol, the correct formulary now?&rsquo; Thank God before I could say anything &lsquo;religious&rsquo; she said, &ldquo;and then I remembered Jesus&rsquo; words on the cross, &lsquo;my God, my God, why have you forsaken me, and I knew that he had been where I was, and I didn&rsquo;t feel alone.&rsquo; And we thanked God for Jesus&rsquo; presence. It is his presence, not our formulas, that makes ministry work.</p>
<p>Temptation 2: The temptation to competitive ministry.</p>
<p>Fresh from the mountain with the inner circle, voice hoarse from his argumentative candidacy for number one disciple, John takes note of a freewheeling healer muscling in on the neighbourhood. He knows a copyright violation when he sees it. His closeness to Jesus makes him proprietary about healing. &lsquo;We saw a guy using your name, Jesus, to force demons out. You know that thing we failed at, couldn&rsquo;t do. Well, someone else who isn&rsquo;t a part of our group succeeded. We have got to put a stop to it. They must be doing something wrong if they are succeeding where we aren&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Jesus he isn&rsquo;t following &lsquo;us&rsquo; &ndash; interesting turn of phrase.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s outrageous. Nothing makes an ambitious disciple of Jesus so seething as the success of another disciple of Jesus who&rsquo;s doing good work outside the Book of Forms. We think we&rsquo;re afraid of death, but it turns out we&rsquo;re afraid of life! &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t cast out demons but Jesus do you want us to stop people who are. We&rsquo;ve got this freelancer. He&rsquo;s not a mainline healer! Probably some sort of swarmy Pentecostal type &ndash; you know that tactile bunch with their hugging, meeting in some theatre &ndash; working our neighbourhood. Can&rsquo;t put my finger on exactly what&rsquo;s wrong here; but it must be wrong! After all, how could he be following Jesus if he isn&rsquo;t following &lsquo;we&rsquo; enfranchised disciples?&rsquo; They are not card-carrying members of the Jesus movement. We&rsquo;ve got to put an end to this.<br>
Jesus says, &lsquo;if he&rsquo;s not against us, he&rsquo;s for us.&rsquo; Turns out the mission of Jesus is larger than us. Turns out that we disciples don&rsquo;t have exclusive rights to the healing ministry of Jesus.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s disturbing &ndash; &lsquo;anyone who isn&rsquo;t against us is for us!&rsquo; Anyone who works for human flourishing and deliverance is an agent of Jesus work in the world. Wow! Doesn&rsquo;t that just reframe ministry expectation.</p>
<p>That view of ministry could get away from us. If you are the kind of person who irons your socks and underwear, lays your clothes out the morning before, this will drive you crazy. What kind of bureaucracy could manage this Spirit generated, random healing, by God knows who? Order that!</p>
<p>This past week I was downtown at a School of Business. I met a Dean and an administrator about teaching some administrative savvy to our students. I was a little shy about the whole enterprise. I apologetically said, &lsquo;yea, sorry about how we religious types are always hammering on business; but the human heart is a little to the left.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;do you remember 2008, the crash of the stock market. Man, we need some spiritual input. I spend my days telling students, you have got to think of the common good, human flourishing in your work. Maybe you guys at VST could come and teach us some ethics.&rsquo; And I sat there thinking &ndash; what? Jesus is at work here too.</p>
<p>Following Jesus into ministry in the wider world is so disorienting. It is even a kind of embarrassment to the church when we find out Jesus is making more progress with ecological renewal, truth and reconciliation through the government and NGO&rsquo;s than with us! Karl Barth calls this a &lsquo;free communication&rsquo; of God&rsquo;s word coming back at the church, almost as if to embarrass us to get with God&rsquo;s program. There are people out there who never went to VST or Regent, who have never dawned the door of a church, uncredentialed freelancers whom Jesus requisitions to get healing done.</p>
<p>Temptation Three: The temptation to take up the dysfunctional dance of pride and envy.<br>
Jesus gives a third talk about his death in chapter 10 &ndash; &lsquo;the disciples were confused as Jesus lead them toward Jerusalem&rsquo; &ndash; that&rsquo;s an understatement. He takes the disciples aside again -&rsquo;let me lay this out for you. I&rsquo;m going to get handed over, be killed, handled by foreigners, spit on, disrespected, beaten, die! Three days later, I&rsquo;ll rise again. Did you get that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>James and John take Jesus aside. Over in Matthew they get mom to agitate for her boys. Here they do it themselves, on the sly. &lsquo;Yeah great thanks for that speech, Jesus.&rsquo; But didn&rsquo;t you say something about a kingdom? We could hardly hear you with those little monsters (kids) making racket. We thought we&rsquo;d do a little backroom deal about the corner offices in the kingdom. I mean we&rsquo;re the A team &ndash; we went up the mountain with you. We&rsquo;d like to be your number one men.&rsquo; James and John have no idea that first in the kingdom has a cruciform shape. Be careful what you ask for. What did Bonhoeffer say, &lsquo;when Jesus calls a man, he bids him come and died.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once word of their ambition gets out to the rest of the disciples, they get mad. Ambition by some disciples, miffs the rest of the disciples.</p>
<p>I know how this discontent goes. &lsquo;They are so proud, you&rsquo;d think a little humility would be in order here.&rsquo; It is a very Canadian objection. We don&rsquo;t like ambitious push to the front of the line types. And sure pride is a sin.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;m never sure when I hear the pride accusation come up whether it&rsquo;s &lsquo;James and John&rsquo; pride or the other disciples&rsquo; envy that&rsquo;s at work. Pride&rsquo;s a no-no in Canada\; envy, however, in a socialist society, our context, is just fine. A couple of ambitious proud disciples can easily summon up envy in the rest of the group. And then the dance is on &ndash; pride and envy provide the rhythm.</p>
<p>Jesus calls the disciples all together and says, &lsquo;ok so you all want to be number one. You all want to be top dog, numero uno, kingdom executives, CEO&rsquo;s in glory.&rsquo; No need to tell all of you to be ambitious and make something of yourselves. I see you want to lead the people under you. You want to be powerful and wield that power top -down. I can see how you&rsquo;d soak that in from executive types like Donald Trump and Party of One politicians.</p>
<p>And then Jesus says, &lsquo;How very pagan of you to think that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>If you want to be great, says Jesus, it&rsquo;s all about how many people you serve. In the upside down world Jesus ushers in, a disciple goes to work for everyone else, and that&rsquo;s greatness &ndash; bottom-of-the-heap, greatness! Now we know what Mark means when he says, &lsquo;Jesus is going to Jerusalem and the disciples are confused&rsquo; &ndash; about leadership among other things.</p>
<p>And then the embodiment of the Son of Man&rsquo;s critique of pagan leadership: &ldquo;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I start to wonder, as you all do, about measure, balance, prudence, burn out, self-care. What are the limits? How many people can a person serve without exhaustion? What about boundaries? Haven&rsquo;t we used these words of Jesus to make some people servants who get walked on?</p>
<p>Yes. All of these questions require our attention. But in this passage I think what we&rsquo;ve got might be paraphrased like this, and it is my conclusion:<br>
&lsquo;Whoever wants to save their leadership, will lose it; and whoever loses it for Jesus&rsquo; sake and the sake of the Gospel, will actually become a Christian leader.&rsquo;</p>
<p><em>Amen. </em></p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Principal&#8217;s Address to Convocation</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Richard-Topping.jpg"/>

<h3>The following address was delivered by Principal Richard Topping on the occasion of Convocation 2015 at Shaughnessy Heights United Church, on Monday, May 11th.</h3>
<p>Chancellor Clarke, graduates, faculty, board, long-suffering spouses and families of our graduates and friends from our neighbouring colleges, welcome.</p>
<p>Today I have three timely words for this convocation: the first is <strong>thanks.</strong></p>
<p>If one of you were to ask me today, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s new?&rdquo; Here is how I would answer.</p>
<p>This fall our school will have four new faculty (Rev. Dr. Jason Byassee, Rabbi Dr. Laura Duhan-Kaplan, Mr. Ray Aldred &ndash; and a new dean at SAH if the General Assembly cooperates)</p>
<p>We will move into a new building at the beginning of August.</p>
<p>This past academic year we received renewed accreditation.</p>
<p>We now have a VST foundation to support the school and we&rsquo;ve renewed our relationship with our denominational partners. Signified by a legacy gift from Capilano United congregation whose doors have closed, but whose gift will support the training of UCC students for ministry in the coming years.</p>
<p>Thanks be to God! for all of this &ndash; and you can read all about it in the printed Principal&rsquo;s report.</p>
<p>All of this is possible because of:</p>
<p>an outstanding Board,</p>
<p>dedicated and talented staff,</p>
<p>faculty and students&nbsp;who make theological education as difficult and delightful as it should be,</p>
<p>the hard work of people who proceeded us,</p>
<p>and our friends and partners.</p>
<p>All of you have supported our calling to engage in</p>
<p>life-changing -</p>
<p>God-loving, Christ-centred</p>
<p>church-mobilizing</p>
<p>world-embracing, partner-seeking</p>
<p>theological education.</p>
<p>Thank you, all of you, thank you so much!</p>
<p>And thank you especially this evening to Profs. Stephen Farris and Paula Sampson who will retire from VST at the end of June, to Ellen-Clarke King, who returns to the parish, and to Past Chancellor Peter Elliot. We are extremely grateful for your years of wise and faithful service.</p>
<p><strong>VST is called to form and educate thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian leaders. </strong>Which is to say that all of the newness &ndash; programs, personnel and premises &ndash; serve this calling for the sake the church and the world<strong>. </strong></p>
<p>What a great time to be alive, to be taught and formed to share in the work of the Gospel in the church and in the world.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my second word &ndash; <strong>&lsquo;non-competitive!</strong>&lsquo;</p>
<p>I am utterly delighted that we present honourary doctorates today &ndash; at one and the same time &ndash; to The Rev. Dr. Ed Searcy and Mr. Philip Owen. It so suits the identity and work of our school.</p>
<p>Dr. Searcy is a faithful and compassionate congregational pastor, whose work at preaching and pastoral care and Christian formation have been outstanding (So much so that his congregation University Hill has established a scholarship in Pastoral Excellence in Ed&rsquo;s honour just this week! &ndash; and we are glad)!!</p>
<p>Mr. Owen, one of the Bishop Somerville&rsquo;s men, and a life-time member of the same Anglican congregation, St. John&rsquo;s Shaughnessy, is a former mayor of Vancouver, who developed the &lsquo;Four Pillar Approach&rsquo; for the treatment of addiction in our city, and beyond.</p>
<p>Theological education and formation is for the church and for the world. The relationship is non-competitive. In fact because theological education is for the church &ndash; its enrichment, the deep formation of Christians in Christ by the Holy Spirit, it is for the world.</p>
<p>Theological education forms and shapes its recipients so that they recognize and get with the humanizing movements God provokes and enter into the pain of the world where healing and tenderness and weeping in Christ&rsquo;s name are called for. The church or the world? No! The church and therefore the world! Absolutely!</p>
<p>I was the guest preacher at a United Church in Calgary. The sermon was a dialogue sermon. The texts for the day included the story of St. Paul&rsquo;s conversion. You know the lights and the voice and the conversion. The minister of that congregation said in front of everyone with just he and I sitting on the platform: &lsquo;hey Richard you&rsquo;re a theologian what do you make of this conversion stuff. I mean we&rsquo;re mainline Christians aren&rsquo;t we sort of against that.&rsquo; Well, I stuttered a bit at this question. Then gave an answer from my favourite theologian, Bob Dylan &ndash; &lsquo;you gotta serve someone.&rsquo; We all spend our lives on something.</p>
<p>And then, Robert came to the mike. Robert wore a t-shirt that was a little too short to cover his stomach; he looked a little unkempt. He went to the pulpit and started to read dead-pan from a hand-written half sheet of paper. &lsquo;I used to live on the street, I was violent. My brother and I used to roll people. And then I stumbled into a church coffee shop. The people there we kind to me and my brother. They helped me kick drugs and alcohol. It took a while, it wasn&rsquo;t easy for them or me. Now I live in a house. I have a dog. I&rsquo;m engaged to be married. God helped me. That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s what I got to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church and therefore the world. There&rsquo;s simply no-competition.</p>
<p>My final word: <strong>recruitment</strong>. This is part where I ask for your help. Vancouver School of Theology is not a easy place to study &ndash; ask a graduate! To take in what we&rsquo;ve got to give, you need calling, courage, guts, holy dissatisfaction with how it is and a yearning for something more in Jesus&rsquo; name. Ministry is tough these days. Leadership in congregations and ministry for the sake of the world, it takes the best that anyone has to pull it off. If you just want credentials on a business card or to fill in time, we are likely not the place.</p>
<p>However, if you or someone you know just can&rsquo;t avoid this calling; if you or someone you know has an almost irresistible summons to serve for the glory of God, the transformation of God&rsquo;s good world and to learn how to do that in Christ&rsquo;s name in collaboration with indigenous peoples and friends of other faiths, then sign up!</p>
<p>My friend, Will Willimon tells the story of a recruiter for teach America who came to Duke University to recruit privileged students to serve in some of the most God-forsaken inner city schools in the US. She said, &lsquo;I know I am just wasting my breathe, you are all set for life, you are the top-academic students who can go wherever you want; but if possibly you might want to waste your life on some of the most challenging people and places in the world, I&rsquo;ve got some material up front. I know that I am just spinning my wheels, she said, but there are some brochures about the work, here on this table. Thanks for your time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Willimon says that there was a stampede to the front of the auditorium. He says that it turns out, &lsquo;student are starving to lose themselves to something greater than themselves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Humm&hellip;</p>
<p>VST could help you do that . . . If anyone is interested, I have some brochures down here at the front.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>Principal&rsquo;s Address</h2>
<p><strong> Chancellor&rsquo;s Dinner</strong><br>
UBC Golf Club<br>
Thursday September 25, 2014<br>
Richard Topping</p>
<p>It is just wonderful to have a packed room this evening. (Thanks to our development department &ndash; David McMillan Shannon Lythgoe and Lisa Wittman) for their hard work, and also to our Chancellor for his kind support this evening)</p>
<p>So many people the food had to go in the hall. That&rsquo;s a problem we&rsquo;ve been praying for. We&rsquo;re so grateful for your interest in our school and, no doubt, in our speaker for this evening, Stevie Cameron. We thank you for your support and for your partnership.</p>
<p>I drove my son to Castlegar, about six years ago, where he enrolled in wildlife and fisheries management. He loves animals. He loves the out of doors. His bent in life was to do this from the time he could move. I&rsquo;d say, it was his calling. On the way to the school, we noticed things like mountains, trees, flowers and wildlife. We observed the world, as far as we could.</p>
<p>Three years later, I went to pick him up and bring him home. Had to take a truck. He accumulated all kinds of stuff &ndash; snow-shoes, skiis, a large back-pack, heaps of outdoor camping equipment, and books, tons of books. The drive home was different than the drive there. It wasn&rsquo;t just the load of stuff we carried in the car. He brought home a load of learning. The conversation went something like this:</p>
<p>Dad, &lsquo;will you look at that: the angeosperms are blooming.&rsquo; What? &lsquo;And did you see that path through the woods, undulates love corridors.&rsquo; Uh? &lsquo;And dad, did you know that the pinus ponderosa has tout needles growing in scopulate (bushy, tuft-like) fascicles of two to three with flame retardant bark.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well no, I didn&rsquo;t know that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have to say as I stand before you this evening: I am in awe of his educators. I couldn&rsquo;t even get him to do the dishes; and these strangers, these educators altered his world! Coming home this son of mine had a new take on reality because of his training. They did not just educate him &ndash; populate his brain with new ideas, they formed him. He saw a different world coming home than he was able to see when he left.</p>
<p>My son lives and acts in the world differently now &ndash; he cares, he knows watersheds, he does live releases of sturgeon early in the morning, rides on a bike to the Fraser just to watch sea lions, gets up at 5:30 a.m. to go whale watching and enthusiast that he is, he drags me with him. He tries to get me to see what he sees. His joy just pulls other people into the wake of his love for the delights of the created world; he&rsquo;s even latched onto other people who love what he loves.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t eat fish in a restaurant unless he sees the ocean wise endorsement on the menu. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an exaggeration to say that his imaginative repertoire was enlarged by his education. He&rsquo;s now got more purchase on the world. In fact, I think he sees a different world now and seeing that different world means he engages the world in new ways, humane ways, even more loving ways, at least most of the time.</p>
<p>Why would I tell you that?</p>
<p>Because that&rsquo;s the kind of transformation we&rsquo;re after in theological education at Vancouver School of Theology;</p>
<ul><li>that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;d build a 21st century facility to support theological education;</li>
<li>that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;d hire outstanding new faculty to serve with us this past year;</li>
<li>that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;d set up a foundation to manage proceeds from the sale of Iona building and for donors to make lasting contributions to the school.</li>
</ul><p>We&rsquo;re not just giving people a few ideas to hold in their heads to satisfy an immobile curiosity at an antiseptic distance from the world. Not at all.</p>
<p>Vancouver School of Theology is called to thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian faith forming thoughtful, engaged and generous leaders for the sake of transformation.</p>
<p>Our vision is that students who attend this school will see a different world when they leave than the one they saw when they arrived.</p>
<p>Our vision is that students who attend this school will have such joy in their calling that other people will be moved by what moves them.</p>
<p>Our vision is that students who are formed by thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian faith will imagine the humane and flourishing life that scripture imagines in Jesus&rsquo; name, and lean toward it, full-throttle, here and now.</p>
<p>Through disciplined thinking, hard study, critical analysis our students engage the big issues of our time out of the deep resources of the Christian faith. Issues like climate change, reconciliation, poverty, peace and isolation. We&rsquo;re stoking the imaginations of our students so they can do&rsquo; traditioned innovation&rsquo; in the church and the world when they leave. We want them to be able to think, not for or by themselves, but with the church, with Aboriginal partners and friends of other faith traditions, for the love of God and the world. We want our students to give wheels to their thinking together with people who also work for justice and peace in the world.</p>
<p>And so as instructors, we&rsquo;re helping them put on the spectacles of scripture so they can see the world as the theatre of the glory of God writ large, and so help other people see what they see with sheer delight.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re teaching that people, all people, are made in God&rsquo;s image and so are loved by God. And that means we&rsquo;re obliged to respect other people, even to look out for their flourishing. That takes biblical and theological education and formation, the refinement of God&rsquo;s calling on a life.</p>
<p>Just this week, a class I teach in Theology read a wonderful piece by a theological educator, Serene Jones, the President of Union Seminary. She talks about her own theological education, and the way it shaped her vision of the world.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is impossible for me to imagine a world without God . . . I cannot look at another person without seeing Jesus loving him or her . . . it is impossible for me to frame humanity in any other way than as Jesus-loved. . . . I see Jesus looking up at Zacchaeus in the tree or toward the lepers living in caves outside the city walls [and it] moves me toward the edge of what we normally see. It is an impulse that drove me toward feminism, liberation theology, a deep commitment to radical justice and a suspicion of the exclusions and repressions that religion itself is constantly enacting . . .&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I think I&rsquo;d called that &lsquo;holy imagination&rsquo;: here&rsquo;s person so stoked in the stories of Jesus, so formed by worship and God-talk, that a frame of reference for how to move and act and see the world is built. Wow! To form a person like this can&rsquo;t be done in a series of weekend alone. It requires intentional community, exposure to exemplars, sustained scholarship through time to form this compassionate imagination.</p>
<p>When the new students arrived this fall, we had orientation. One morning we sat in a circle and answered the question, so why are you here? Around the circle we went listening to the stories of students&rsquo; calls to serve God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A year ago, if you told me I&rsquo;d be here, I would have just laughed. Well. here I am. God has a sense of humour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another said, &lsquo;I was afraid to tell my husband that God was calling me to theological education and service in the church, when I did, he said, &ldquo;well it is about time, I knew it 20 years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve got a group of students whose registrations have been, well divinely solicited. Another Professor who was sitting in the circle next to me said to me, &lsquo;well, God&rsquo;s been busy with this mob.&rsquo; The whole event made me hopeful for the church and for all kinds of God service in the world.</p>
<p>Our task at VST is now to stoke the call to service, with thoughtful, engaged and generous theological formation. Our task is to work hard so that the world that these students see when they are done is rich, God centred, a place for gracious and humane action, a joyous and solicitous reality.</p>
<p>And we can use your help. Theological education requires not just the funding of imagination, but the funding of the program. Donations of all sizes help us with our core project of preparing leaders for the church and world for this time.</p>
<p>Promising students and accomplished Professors are a priority.</p>
<p>We want to prepare students for service who have promise for ministry in the church and the world. Scholarships allow excellent students to finish debt free and to give the whole of their time to studies so they can complete their programs in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Student awards, like the one just established by West Van U. for excellence in preaching and pastoral theology in honour of their former minister and now St. Andrew&rsquo;s Hall professor, Ross Lockhart, help the school recognize excellence in our graduates.</p>
<p>Professorial chairs are crucial &ndash; great professors attract outstanding students for the good of the church and the world. We&rsquo;re delighted at the Butler Chair in preaching. It was established by a gift of over three million dollars from Ralph and Laura Butler. We&rsquo;re seeking its first incumbent this year. We&rsquo;d love to have a chair in Christian Spirituality since it is especially important to the formation of thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian leaders.</p>
<p>Students learn at VST from a distance so we need to invest more heavily in technology that allows us to deliver theological education virtually, at least for part of the program.</p>
<p>We would, I would, love to talk to you about these and other ways in which you can support the vitality of the school, as a leading 21st century real-life centre of theological education and formation.</p>
<p>In the middle of your table there are envelopes you can use to help support the work of VST. We hope you will use them, now, or take them with you in order to consider how you might contribute to our work of education and formation for service to God &ndash; the church and the world.</p>
<p>In conclusion, let me introduce five students (there are more and they are sitting around the room): they all exemplify thoughtful, engaged and generous leadership &ndash;</p>
<p>First a couple of our recent graduates, who now carry their formation at VST to the church and the world.</p>
<p>Meet Mark Munn one of our graduates, who works at Covenant House. It&rsquo;s a place where homeless youth &ndash; sometimes rejected by their families and with addictions find sanctuary, love and a brighter future. Mark has told me several times that his theological education prepared him for his work of compassion, outreach and mercy at Covenant House. Forming thoughtful, engaged and generous faith in our students changes how they see and act in the world.</p>
<p>Meet Liz Hamel, a wonderful musician, just ordained a deacon. She came to us with a second-career calling to the deaconate and refined it, stoked it, fired it up with theological vision and now she&rsquo;s engaged in it at Christ Church Cathedral. Liz does pastoral care in the parish.</p>
<p><strong>Let me introduce you to three of our current students:</strong></p>
<p>Meet Jillian Jackson who realized her life was called into a new direction when after the birth of her daughter, Poppy, she found herself consuming books on Christian theology. Jill and her husband came to Canada from Melbourne, she now works as a Nurse at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS at St. Paul&rsquo;s Hospital at the same time as she pursues her theological studies in preparation for UCC ministry.</p>
<p>Meet The Rev. Mary Fontaine. She is both a graduate and a current student and a Volunteer at VST. Mary is working on an advanced degree in indigenous and inter-religious studies. At the same time, Mary is Director of Hummingbird Ministries, a work dedicated to furthering reconciliation and healing between Canada&rsquo;a aboriginal peoples and the PCC. In her spare time, Mary is Chair of the Native Ministries Consortium, which has created new and effective ways of developing native leaders for native congregations &ndash; through an extension M. Div and NMC summer school held at VST. Proceeds from this evening&rsquo;s event will go to the support of the NMC summer school for next summer.</p>
<p>Ribka Makuba-Mayor came to us two years ago from West Papua, Indonesia. Ribka is the third student from Indonesia recently to attend VST. Ribka is doing an MAIIS degree, Master of Arts in Indigenous and Inter-Religious studies. Ribka found a welcoming community with Aboriginal students in our NMC programs since she is a First Nation&rsquo;s person from Papua. She&rsquo;s enriched us with her stories, and accumulated theological tools to do scholarly analysis of her own West Papua culture &ndash; where life is not easy.</p>
<p>Ribka thought she was going home in June this summer. However, because of medical complications, Ribka gave birth to her daughter, Indemina 3 months early! The little one has just been released from hospital. We have been thanking God that she was here, because of the measure of medical care required.</p>
<p>We also thank God for a special fund for Indonesian students established by the late Dien Horstman Pieters-East that helped make Ribka&rsquo;s time at VST possible. Bringing students from elsewhere in the world requires considerable resources, and scholarships enable us to do so.</p>
<p>Friends, VST strives to deliver on its promise to form thoughtful, engaged and generous leaders for the church and the world. Please take the time to talk to our students and professors around the room. I invite you to support the vision and the mission of Vancouver School of Theology. Thank you!</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">The Uses of Literature by Rita Felski: A Positive Aesthetic</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Gutenberg_Bible_4.jpg"/>

<p>Sometimes reading outside your field can be so very helpful to work in your field. I was greatly helped by this book on literature by Rita Felski. Her joy at reading and the way in which she holds together personal and transformative engagement with literature and scholarly engagement with the same is quite wonderful. I found the book instructive to me as a reader of the Bible and theologian. I wrote a brief review for Good Reads, which I share below.</p>
<p>In <em>Uses of Literature</em>, Rita Felski, professor of literary criticism at University of Virginia, explores the simple fact that engagements with literature change people&rsquo;s lives. Students come to the formal study of literature often because they have been enchanted by the way art and literature change things, re-contextualize and alter experience of the world.</p>
<p>The book maintains an argument with contemporary interpretative tendency to conflate critical reading to suspicious reading with its heavily freighted explanatory frameworks and distanced analytic. A feminist theorist herself, she challenges the dogmas and defaults of contemporary critical theory &ndash; feminist, marxist, historicist, post-structuralist and post-colonial. She argues that what they hold in common is &lsquo;the discourse of disenchantment&rsquo; which &lsquo;reiterates and reinforces the very condition that it describes, sinking us ever deeper into the void of a dispiriting, self-corroding skepticism&rsquo; (58).</p>
<p>The book is a manifesto which builds on growing discontent among cultural and literary critics who sense that dialogue with literature has given way to &lsquo;permanent diagnosis&rsquo; assigning &lsquo;all value to the act of reading (and the reader) and none to the objects read&rsquo; (3). I found that comment so helpful in the light of some programs for biblical and theological interpretation that so foreground the world of the reader, his or her own autobiography and their context , that the actual text of the bible and its interpretation seems secondary. Felski wants to recover the way texts can &lsquo;bite back&rsquo; (7) in the process of interpretation. Following Marjorie Perloff, Felski argues for respect of an artwork&rsquo;s view of the world rather than &lsquo;treating it as a confirmation of our own pet theories&rsquo; (5).</p>
<p>The book roughs out a positive aesthetic which, while appreciative of the language of interrogation of texts combines &lsquo;analysis <em>and attachment</em>, critique <em>and love&rsquo;</em> (22). The question the book asks and answers in the affirmative is this: &ldquo;Is it possible to discuss the value of literature without falling into truisms and platitudes, sentimentality and <em>Schwarmerei</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uses of literature is divided into four chapters: recognition, enchantment, knowledge and shock. And each is a consideration of the act of reading under these rubric. Felski draws on a broad repertoire of examples to illustrate the power of what is read to resonate, enchant, propose and dis/re-disorient the reader.</p>
<p>The chapter on enchantment is particularly powerful. She pushes back against reductive &lsquo;contextual&rsquo; reading, which almost always dissolves texts into the circumstances of origin (She has an essay entitled: Context Stinks!). She beautifully describes how texts have a power to recontextualize the reader. &ldquo;If we are entirely caught up in a text, we can no longer place it in a context because it is the context, imperiously dictating the terms of its reception. We are held in a condition of absorption . . . transfixed and immobilized by the work and rendered unable to frame, contextualize or judge&rsquo; (57). The world of the text becomes the world the reader inhabits so everything gets a new frame of reference. Christians have talked about Bible reading that way (Eric Auerbach noted this same dynamic in bible reading in his <em>Mimesis</em>). The affective and absorbing aspects of reading are featured here in a manner that connects with recent interest in beauty as a way of reorienting critical conversation. The chapter concludes with a defense of enchantment against the main charges of delusion and disablement. Felski knows the charges of pietism and naivet&eacute; that will follow on her proposal. She challenges the view that only through&rsquo; critical distance&rsquo; we get at the truth of things. &rsquo;Once we face up to the limits of demystification as a critical method and a theoretical ideal, once we relinquish the modern dogma that our lives should be thoroughly disenchanted, we can truly begin to engage the affective and absorptive, the sensual and somatic qualities of aesthetic experience&rsquo; (76).</p>
<p>The final chapter on &lsquo;shock&rsquo; explores the power of texts to resonate across time. Here the argument engages historicism, &lsquo;synchonic historicism.&rsquo; Felski argues that literary meaning isn&rsquo;t limited to a flash and that texts have power to resonate across time. Shock is difficult in our time, since moderns and postmoderns have institutionalized shock, we are &lsquo;shockaholics.&rsquo; Nevertheless, she makes the case that texts are always ticking. &lsquo;We might think of such texts as time travelers, incendiary bombs packed with an explosive force that unleashes itself long after the moment of manufacture&rsquo; (115). She deploys the German term &lsquo;<em>Nachtraglichkeit</em>&lsquo; &ndash; afterwardness &ndash; to capture the sense that texts are not embedded once and for all in the circumstances of their production, but &lsquo;diffused across a temporal medium&rsquo; (119). She doesn&rsquo;t say it but here I was thinking Holy Spirit and Scripture.</p>
<p>In a particularly interesting passage, especially for someone like me who interprets the two testaments of the Christian bible, she explores the power of retrospective reading. Felski offers language which I think makes explicit what Christians, beginning with the New Testament writers, have done with first testament interpretation. Because there is lag-time between an occurrence and its resonance, meaning can be &lsquo;washed forward into the future rather than anchored in one defining moment. . . . Retrospection recreates the past even as it retrieves it, in a mutual contamination and co-mingling of different times&rsquo; (119). Beautifully said.</p>
<p>My appreciation for the book was three-fold:</p>
<p>1) I just loved Felski&rsquo;s articulation of a mode of interpretation which is able to receive the otherness of a text, rather than simply to use the text as a confirmation of a heavily freighted suspicion. Her direction to the work of Eve Sedgwick (&lsquo;Paranoid Reading and Reparative Reading: or, You&rsquo;re so Paranoid, you Probably Think This Essay is About You&rsquo;) &ndash; who characterized suspicious hermeneutics as &lsquo;paranoid&rsquo; was instructive. Felski points to more recent literary scholarship which troubles suspicion as self-defeating and inhibits actual engagement with texts. One of her main points is that suspicious reading (paranoia) is a strong theory, in the sense that very often it can&rsquo;t do anything other than prove the assumptions with which it begins. Hold to strong Freudian, post-colonial or other post-modern species of suspicion and the text just becomes an instance of what I already think.</p>
<p>2) I found some great help for the work of biblical interpretation here. Biblical interpretation sometimes suffers from the same malaise as interpretative theory more generally with its heavy investments in suspicious orientations of one sort or another. This piece with its&rsquo; attention to how texts ( and here I am thinking about the Bible) recontextualize the reader by recognition, enchantment, proposal of a world and shock, was very helpful. Her suspicion of suspicion helps break-up the current interpretative monopoly; and</p>
<p>3) while a technical book, it is beautifully written and draws the reader into a whole constellation of wonderful texts. Her engagement with the Kiss of the Spider Woman by Manuel Puig to illustrate how narrative worlds can draw us out of safe &lsquo;scholarly&rsquo; engagement into life-changing reading is wonderful.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Webster: Why Study Theology?</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/study.jpg"/>

<p>I&rsquo;m really grateful to my doctoral advisor and friend, Prof. John Webster of St Andrew&rsquo;s School of Divinity, for this great piece on the question: &ldquo;Why should theological study be a primary occupation for the Christian minister?&rdquo; In it John is attentive to the importance of contemplation of God as ingredient to pastoral formation and inspiration for service to the Gospel. In a School that is called to thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian faith for the formation of thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian leaders, this reminder is crucial.</p>
<p>For a list of Prof. Webster&rsquo;s publications and interests see:<br><a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/divinity/about/news/title,217819,en.php">st-andrews.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Richard Topping, Principal, VST</p>
<h2>Professor John Webster</h2>

<h4>Why should theological study be a primary occupation for the Christian minister?</h4>
<p>Pastoral ministry is apostolic practice. Its origin lies in the apostolic vocation of the church: in the fact that the church as a whole and its pastors in particular are called and sent to be ambassadors and heralds of Jesus Christ, the one who is himself sent from God and who in his person constitutes and announces the gospel. From this origin and vocation, pastoral ministry derives a definite content and task: the &lsquo;matter&rsquo; which is to govern and direct all its activities is Christ and his gospel. The gospel reaches back into the infinite ocean of God&rsquo;s own life (&lsquo;in the beginning was the Word&rsquo;) and reaches forward into the created world which is the object of God&rsquo;s unrestricted benevolence (&lsquo;the Word became flesh and dwelt among us&rsquo;). In the gospel we find God&rsquo;s loving instruction of guilty and sad creatures, whose treason against their creator is such that they have lost their way, and no longer know who or where they are or how to reach out to happiness. To these creatures &ndash; to us &ndash; the gospel holds out illumination and healing. As it is set before us, we come to know who God is, what we are made to be, where we have gone astray, how we have been sought and recovered, in what way we may begin to flourish. Pastoral ministry in all its various undertakings &ndash; in teaching and preaching, in administering the gospel sacraments, in seeking the lost, in offering consolation and correction and direction &ndash; is the indication, extension and application of apostolic truth in all its goodness and restorative power.</p>
<p>Yet apostolic practice is not the heart of ministerial work; in all its necessity, dignity and importance, it is secondary and derivative. The first act of ministerial work is that of receiving and meditating upon divine instruction. The apostles are disciples &ndash; learners &ndash; before they are apostles. Gathered into his presence, keeping company with him, they receive the inestimable benefit of his teaching: &lsquo;I have given them the words which thou gavest me &hellip; I made them to know thy name.&rsquo; On the basis and power of this instruction alone do the disciples become apostles: &lsquo;I have sent them into the world.&rsquo; Apostolic ministry in the church, likewise, is orderly and fruitful when it follows the instruction of the Holy Spirit, sent by Christ to recall us to God and the ways of God in the gospel. Pastoral ministry has its foundation in contemplation of the gospel, and its goal in passing on to others the fruit of contemplation.</p>
<p>This is why theological study is the indispensable preparation for and accompaniment of the exercise of pastoral office. Theology is contemplative consideration of the gospel and its claims upon thought and conduct. Yet neglect of theological contemplation is commonplace. Some shirk it as too exacting; others judge it a distraction from the proper occupations of the minister. Distaste for contemplation may be compounded by the allure of a culturally-authoritative model of the leader as busy manager and problem-solver rather than thinker. And theologians, too, must shoulder much responsibility for distaste for contemplation: many pastors experience theological study as abstract, technical and spiritually barren. Some &ndash; perhaps much &ndash; contemporary theology and theological instruction participates in the centuries-long drift of the discipline away from the setting of the church and the task of formation of godly reason and love of truth, and its giving of itself to other &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; tasks.</p>
<p>The disarray of some kinds of theology is all the more reason for retrieving theology&rsquo;s principal vocation, which is by contemplation to consider God and all things in relation to God. The fruits of theological contemplation are, first, knowledge of and love for the gospel and the gospel&rsquo;s God, and, second, the shaping of conduct. Unformed by such knowledge and love, pastoral ministry risks debasement: it may accompany the world earnestly and solicitously, it may offer some kind of exhortation and encouragement, it may be full of confident therapeutic technique, but it will have little to say about how in Christ God&rsquo;s creatures have been reconciled by infinite love. Among the things which the early Anglican ordinals ask God to supply to those entering into pastoral office is &lsquo;replenishment in the truth of divine doctrine&rsquo;. The agent of such replenishment is God himself; its principal instrument is Holy Scripture, in which the prophets and apostles communicate divine teaching. But theology, too, has its part to play: grounded in prayer, quiet dedication to and delight in theological study are a primary means of acquiring apostolic wisdom and renewing apostolic practice.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas prayed thus before study:</p>
<p>Ineffable Creator&hellip;<br>
You are proclaimed<br>
the true font of light and wisdom,<br>
and the primal origin<br>
raised high beyond all things.</p>
<p>Pour forth a ray of your brightness<br>
into the darkened places of my mind;<br>
disperse from my soul the twofold darkness<br>
into which I was born:<br>
sin and ignorance.</p>
<p>You make eloquent the tongues of infants.<br>
Refine my speech<br>
and pour forth upon my lips<br>
the goodness of your blessing.</p>
<p>Grant to me keenness of mind,<br>
capacity to remember,<br>
skill in learning,<br>
subtlety to interpret,<br>
and eloquence in speech.</p>
<p>May you guide the beginning of my work,<br>
direct its progress,<br>
and bring it to completion.</p>
<p>You who are true God and truly human,<br>
Who live and reign,<br>
world without end.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Remembering Jim and Anne McCullum</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Blossoms.jpg"/>

<h3>In the Fall of 2014, VST lost two dear friends and former colleagues, Jim and Anne McCullum, who passed away within 3 weeks of one another. Following are the full texts of the obituaries and comments received by VST, commemorating Jim and Anne.</h3>
<h2><strong>The Reverend Dr. James Alexander McCullum</strong></h2>
<p>June 27, 1935 &ndash; November 3, 2014</p>
<p>Jim McCullum was a loving husband, father, grandfather, pastor, mentor, and friend.</p>
<p>Jim was born in 1935 in Vancouver; when his mother travelled to and from Yukon by steamship to access good medical care for his caesarean birth. He was predeceased by his two older brothers, Stewart (1930) and Hugh (2006).</p>
<p>Because of his father&rsquo;s work as an Anglican priest, Jim&rsquo;s childhood was spent in Yukon and northern Ontario. It was at Queen&rsquo;s University (Kingston) that Jim McCullum met Anne Keenleyside. When friends gathered at his parents&rsquo; home before a dance, Jim&rsquo;s father Creighton took him aside and indicating Anne, whispered &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the one for you.&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s death was just three weeks after Anne&rsquo;s and confirms how right Creighton was. It is a&nbsp;comfort to know that they are together again, free of everything that made their recent years challenging.</p>
<p>Jim and Anne were married in 1960 in Victoria. Their wedding followed a year of daily letters written to each other while Anne lived and travelled in Europe with her family, and Jim completed his studies. Jim studied theology at Wycliffe College (Toronto), was ordained priest on October 18, 1961 at Grace Church on the Hill (Toronto) and received his Doctor of Ministry in 1988 from Pacific School of Religion (Berkeley).</p>
<p>In his doctoral thesis, Jim described the first chapter of his ministry in this way:&nbsp;<em>I was a parish priest for 20 years&nbsp;</em>(Toronto, Dawson City, Whitehorse, Trail, Kelowna, and Vancouver)<em>. </em></p>
<blockquote><p>During that time I worked as a pastor in remote areas, small towns, and a large city. In every place I preached Sunday by Sunday about the love of God, the call to justice, the stories of redemption found in the Bible and daily life, and the power of the spirit who brings us together in mission and enables us to strive for shalom.</p>
<p>I stood by the bedsides of dying people and was honoured by what they taught me about faith, life, and meaning. I taught and was taught by confirmation classes, as young people struggled with their faith and life questions, and what all that had to do with God and Church. I met with artists to talk about the meaning of Advent, or Pentecost, so that they could portray the meaning without words.</p>
<p>I prayed with people who had forgotten how to pray, or what that word even means. I listened to angry people tell stories, about the way they had been hurt by church, by institutions, by themselves. I gathered with people of the community concerned about abused women and children, and we opened a transition house. I studied the Bible with 12 women, every Thursday morning, for 4 years. I planned worship with other people, lay and ordained, and learned about integrating the word, and the sacraments, and our lives. But I wasn&rsquo;t a theologian.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second chapter of Jim&rsquo;s ministry was at the Vancouver School of Theology (VST) where he served as Director of Field Education and Professor of Pastoral Theology. During a life-changing sabbatic leave in 1985 Jim realized that in addition to his roles as educator, pastor, priest, administrator, and sometime prophet, he was also a theologian. His ministry had been a series of stories with deep meaning, and action came from reflection on those stories, a model he then shared with his students.</p>
<p>Jim didn&rsquo;t stop working when he retired from VST. He continued to use his skills and energy in communities where he could make a difference. This included adult literacy coaching at the Carnegie Centre, reading support with school children, advocacy for homecare workers in Soweto, and chairing the Board of Aunt Leah&rsquo;s Independent Lifeskills Society.</p>
<p>The onset of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease in final year of his life brought many challenges for Jim and his family. It was remarkable to witness the grace with which he accepted his limitations and increasing dependency on others, and the new relationships he made.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is wonderful that so many people were able to visit with Jim around the time of Anne&rsquo;s memorial service, surrounding him with loving support. He spent his final day in his bed at Little Mountain Place, visited by family and dear friends, and receiving comfort care and support from the staff who had taken such care of him over the past eight months.</p>
<p>At the time of his retirement from VST, Mary and David borrowed from his observations about roles of elders in Aboriginal cultures to describe Jim&rsquo;s life and work. As we celebrate his life, we again remember Jim as storyteller, tradition- bearer, intergenerational bridge, conflict mediator, time-keeper, counsel for the community, memory-keeper, lamenter, and humourist.</p>
<h2><strong>Anne Katherine Margaret McCullum </strong></h2>
<p>1938 &ndash; 2014</p>
<p>Anne lived for her family, friends, church community, and for people in need. She was a dedicated list-writer, organizer, and correspondent and was an incredibly intentional friend and citizen.</p>
<p>Anne was born in 1938 in Ottawa, Ontario and was the younger sister of Mary and Miles and older sister to Lynn. As the daughter of a diplomat, she also lived in Mexico City, New York, London, and Victoria.</p>
<p>It was at Queen&rsquo;s University (Kingston) that Anne Keenleyside met Jim McCullum. There was a gathering of friends at his parents&rsquo; home before a dance and Jim&rsquo;s father Creighton took him aside and while indicating Anne, whispered &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the one for you&rdquo; in his ear. Was he ever right!</p>
<p>Anne and Jim were married in 1960 in Victoria. She was a loving wife, mother and grandmother, caring deeply about the interests and well-being of each member of the family. Through Jim&rsquo;s work as an Anglican priest, the family lived in Toronto, Yukon, Rugby, Trail, Kelowna, and Vancouver. They have worked diligently to maintain relationships and correspondence with people from each of those chapters.</p>
<p>It was very important to Anne to be a good citizen and mother. Her parents spent their lives in the service of others, and she and Jim taught their children tostand up for what they feel is important and modelled support for those less able to make their voices heard. Gender, race, orientation, food, shelter, and justice were all frequent dinner table conversations.</p>
<p>Some highlights of Anne&rsquo;s intentions in action:</p>
<ul><li>Social housing: Anne was a founding member of the 127 Society for Housing which provides affordable homes to 265 people in downtown Vancouver;</li>
<li>Political pressure: Anne was a vigorous correspondent. She frequently wrote to politicians and unless a reasonable response was received, would follow up and require that the concern be addressed;</li>
<li>Social justice: Anne and Jim worked tirelessly in their local communities, and across regional and national boundaries. One example was travelling to Central America in the 1980s to witness the struggle for peace and freedom;</li>
<li>Education and self-improvement: Anne was constantly learning. She kept lists of what she read, and was always suggesting and providing books, articles, and TV shows to friends and family. Her children could always expect an envelope of clippings and copies with each visit;</li>
<li>Inclusion: family dinners often included those who were otherwise alone, travelers with interesting stories, and people with few or no options. There was no question that her friends were made and her support offered with no regard for what a person looked or sounded like, or with whom they were in love; and</li>
<li>Rigor: she lived her values and required leaders and organizations she supported to do the same. Her thoughtful attention to end of life planning was a clear example of how seriously she took that responsibility.</li>
</ul><p>Beyond her home, Anne was employed as a social worker in Toronto and Vancouver, a high school and theological college librarian, and a chaplain at BC Children&rsquo;s Hospital. In every role she made strong friendships, helped to improve the way that services were delivered, and always placed the needs of those being served before her own.</p>
<p>The many messages from people whose lives intersected with hers have included common themes: compassion, kindness, service, justice, warmth, love, determination, friendship, and gentle strength. There can be no better measure of a life well lived, and Anne McCullum left this world a better place.</p>
<p>In Anne&rsquo;s memory, we invite you to send a birthday card, listen to CBC radio, watch public television, help someone you don&rsquo;t know, spend time with a child, and support an organization doing work you believe in.</p>
<h2><strong>Homily at the Memorial Service for Anne McCullum</strong></h2>
<p>Christ Church Cathedral:&nbsp;October 23, 2014.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;But Jesus, when he saw this, was indignant.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Anne McCullum loved children and when we were reviewing the detailed instructions that she left for her memorial service, this reading from Mark&rsquo;s gospel was one of her choices. Considerately, she left options for us in her lists of readings. Ellen and I thought that this reading about Jesus receiving the children was very apt for Anne and not what you usually hear at a memorial service. So in consultation with the family we settled on it.</p>
<p>But the more I turned it over in my mind, the more appropriate it seemed. Of course because of the children&mdash;she loved her grandchildren in particular but that love extended to all children in whom she absolutely delighted. More than that though, what we have, in this short <em>pericope</em>, is a moment of Jesus indignation, perhaps even exasperation at his friends for not getting it. What makes it appropriate for Anne&rsquo;s service, in my view, is that she shied not away from the difficult conversation, from naming when her deep values were at odds with practice or thinking. Anne was no stranger to holy indignation.</p>
<p>Neither was Jesus. As much as church and society try to domesticate him, he keeps rising from our efforts to reduce him to a benign sage: in his parables and teaching he keeps turning the world upside down, subverting our view of the proper ordering of things, and seeing God&rsquo;s grace manifest not in the powerful and mighty but in the weak and vulnerable. The disciples rebuked those who wanted to bring children to him and this really made Jesus angry. He was indignant. Despite the language of the old children&rsquo;s hymn <em>When mothers of Salem their children brought to Jesus</em> I don&rsquo;t think he sweetly smiled and kindly said his words of welcome. I think he was angry at the disciples, who, characteristically in Mark&rsquo;s gospel, just didn&rsquo;t get it. The kingdom of God, that ironic phrase he used to subvert the claims of empire, belongs to the children in their willingness to receive the welcome of the Incarnate one.</p>
<p>Stories like this one inspired Anne McCullum. Over the years of knowing her I have had many, many conversations with her that were about difficult, sensitive situations. She was like a barometer for me; if she was feeling like something around here was going sideways, I paid attention because her perceptions were so grounded in her values and her faith. She would speak the truth as she saw it, and struggle with how to find the kindest and most just way to proceed in the midst of the complex and sometimes confusing situations. And when it was resolved, Anne would take the timeto write to me or call and express appreciation and thanks.</p>
<p>I continue to be astounded with how Jesus Christ is alive in the church and in the world. I know we say we believe in the resurrection, believe in the church being the Body of Christ, believe in the presence of Christ in the sacrament of holy communion: but when you actually see someone whose life has been shaped and formed by the living Christ, well it&rsquo;s breathtaking.</p>
<p>Of course Anne was not perfect&mdash;none of us are; and we know that the last few years have been challenging for her. Through all of it however Anne has remained faithful to her family, to Jim, and most importantly to her values of justice and care and kindness and honesty. All those values were grounded in her Christian faith. And now as we grieve her death and celebrate her life we can say and sing the words of our faith tradition with a deep confidence in the God in whom she trusted. And just as Jesus welcomed the little children with graciousness and love we know that God will welcome Anne into that place where there is no more sorrow or sadness, neither sighing but life everlasting. May her well earned rest be in peace and her rising be in Glory with Christ. Amen.</p>

<h2>Letter to Dr. Rev. Robert Smith from Rev. Brenda Fawkes (VST Director of Field Education)</h2>
<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>I am so very grateful that you are charged me with this task&mdash;how fortunate for all of us gathered to have your words and presence at a time like this. I&nbsp;still&nbsp;get caught off guard with the reality check that Jim is not there to stop in and visit when I want or need to.&nbsp;How can this be? I have always been aware of the strength he offered me and yet these last five days have brought a hurtful clarity to that.</p>
<p>As a teacher and advisor at VST Jim was a gentle soul&mdash;attentive to students and the potential he saw in them. He particularly wanted to use his stature as a white male to lift up the voice of women and minorities. He had an&nbsp;authenticity&nbsp;detector and always wanted students to be the best you, you could be. He hated abuse or manipulation and would challenge it in a strong and yet non confrontational manner.&nbsp; As students in the 90&rsquo;s we still communicated by way of a notice board in the rotunda of the Iona building. Jim could work miracles by his handwritten note to acknowledge a milestone, encourage a moment or offer a prayer. He would arrive faithfully at community worship every Thursday and sit in his same location in the chapel. HIs presence bled out encouragement and support.&nbsp;You knew you had &ldquo;done good&rdquo; if by the time you ate lunch and returned to the Iona building there was a note of support waiting under your name from Jim full of affirmation.</p>
<p>Jim was artful in his ability to place students in field ed sites. This&nbsp;was&nbsp;because&nbsp;he took the time to KNOW us and imagine a best learning environment where we could grow and thrive.</p>
<p>I remember the conversation when Jim retired. People kept asking him what he was going to do when&nbsp;retired. First he&nbsp;would&nbsp;say: &ldquo;I am going to get old and grumpy!&rdquo; Then he said that he tried to pull from his working life what gave him most satisfaction and then try to echo that in his volunteer work. One of the two (I only remember one but there were two) he said was that he gained great satisfaction in helping people find their voice. So one of the jobs he took on was helping others learn to read at the Carnegie Centre. Personally whenever I faced something in my ministry that was on the edge of my&nbsp;abilities&nbsp;or on the edge of my confidence and I asked Jim for advice he would take a very long pause.&nbsp;His answer was usually: What <strong>do you </strong>think you should do?&nbsp;Or, he would tell a story of his own&nbsp;frailty&nbsp;or a time when he had messed up or not quite got it right. &nbsp;Such humility. And when those moments came when I would have to rise to a challenge I would look out in the congregation and there Jim and Anne would be.</p>
<p>Jim also had just enough&nbsp;cynicism&nbsp;in him&mdash;of the church, of the institution, of life to make him real and funny. He took his ministry and obligations seriously and himself lightly enough to be a life long learner.</p>
<p>I think that is probably enough from my slice of the pie. &nbsp;Again thanks for asking and blessings on your preparing.</p>
<p>Brenda Fawkes</p></blockquote>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Mentoring Into Ministry</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/watercolour.jpg"/>

<h2>Dr. Will Willimon</h2>
<p>Professor of the Practice of Christian Ministry<br>
Used with permission of the Author</p>
<p>Craig Kocher, who has endured much mentoring by me, came across a Thoreau quote that sounded as if it had been said by me:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me anything to the purpose of life.</p></blockquote>
<p>When he interviewed me for the job of Dean of Duke Chapel, the first question Terry Sanford asked was, &ldquo;Who are your mentors?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a revealing question to put to a pastor. We get our word mentor from Homer&rsquo;s Odyssey, in which old Mentor led young Telemachus into life. The Greeks knew that most of us journey no further than our mentors are able to take us.</p>
<p>As Bishop I met regularly with my new and young pastors, asking them how I could support their leadership. Their most frequent request: give us more mentors. Their request made me feel old. As a young pastor in the late 60s, I would never have asked some old guy to mentor me. If our parents were wrong about Viet Nam and Civil Rights, there was a good chance they were wrong on everything. So our generation&rsquo;s plea was, Get out of the way and let us take over!</p>
<p>Through the years I have been privileged, as a theology professor and as Bishop, to mentor dozens of developing pastoral leaders. Many of the skills required to be a good mentor are the same required to be a good coach. One must know well the young person being mentored, when criticize and when to praise, and a host of other skills including the ability not to come across as an insufferable old bore when talking to callow youth.</p>
<p>Being back at Duke Divinity School has again given me the opportunity to cultivate my love of mentoring. It&rsquo;s quite a rush to have some young supplicant to ask, &ldquo;Have you got time to give me some advice?&rdquo; Yet I&rsquo;ve also been reminded of the challenge developing clergy face in being mentored by old guys like me.</p>
<p>Hegel said that history is our best teacher and that we move forward by learning from the past. Trouble is, Hegel also noted that current, unexpected events keep disrupting history and invalidating what we thought we knew from past experience, rendering history useless. Therein is the problem faced by those who would submit to mentoring.</p>
<p>Mainline Protestantism is not doing well. Have you noticed? The present age presents us with new challenges. I am unclear about the precise directions the church ought to take, but I know enough to know that our churches must be led differently if we are to have a different future than the rather diminished one to which many feel we are fated.</p>
<p>Thus I began my Introduction to Christian Leadership class by admitting to the students that it was going to be tough for me to get through all of this material on ordained leadership in one semester. Then I told the students that their job was more difficult than mine. They had not only to soak up any insights gained from my experience, inculcate my best practices, and to profit from any wisdom I had to offer, at the same time they had to keep telling themselves, &ldquo;This old guy did ministry the way he knew how, in the way he was most comfortable, given his limitations. I&rsquo;ve got to serve the church in a world other than that in which he served. Furthermore, we work for a living, sovereign God, not an easily managed idol. Lord, give me the wisdom to know what of this professor&rsquo;s wisdom must be tossed if I am faithfully to lead your church into your future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In our appointment of clergy, my church tends to privilege experience, years served, and seniority, even though no seniority system is mentioned in the United Methodist Book of Discipline. The sad results of this boring approach to clergy deployment are all around us. We choke to death o the geriatric virtues of maturity, balance, and careful procedure when what our moribund system needs are more clergy who are young, brash, reckless, and stupid. That is new pastoral leaders who will give God enough room to get in this staid old church and do the sort of resurrection that this God does so well.</p>
<p>So go ahead. Humor me. Listen to my war stories (including the ones about how I rescued Alabama Methodism with my bare hands). Write down my knock down, absolutely effective principles for good ecclesiastical leadership. But promise me that you will then silently pray, &ldquo;Lord, please help me to get past this old guy&rsquo;s advice. You have called me to set right the stuff he messed up. Forgive him Lord. He&rsquo;s never been in the church that you, Lord want me to lead. Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All you young new clergy listen to me. Write this down. I have lots of experience and wisdom. I know what I&rsquo;m talking about. Write this down.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Sallie McFague on The Power of Words</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sator_Square_at_OppÃ¨de.jpg"/>

<p>Richard Topping has asked me to write an entry for his Principal&rsquo;s blog and I am happy to do so. A topic that is often on my mind is the power of words. When faced with a big issue&mdash;for instance, one like climate change&mdash;folks often don&rsquo;t remember this. They plead that we &ldquo;stop talking&rdquo; and &ldquo;take action.&rdquo; But for us human beings, words are actions; it is our language ability that separates us from the other animals. It is our ability to create in words the &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; within which we live (our self-consciousness) that is our blessing and our curse. Jesus with his parables and Hitler with his Nazi rhetoric are examples of very different languages that result in profoundly different actions. And of all our language about any and all topics, our talk about God, our theology, is our most demanding and significant topic. Augustine used his highest, best language when speaking about God because he considered it our most important subject. Words are difficult and dangerous. Erich Heller, a German philosopher, warned, &ldquo;Be careful how you interpret the world; it is like that.&rdquo; This came to my mind listening to Richard&rsquo;s speech on October 18 at the Convocation inducting him as VST&rsquo;s 7th Principal. The talk was eloquent and economical&mdash;it said something important and did so in 8 minutes! Its ending sentence gave a summary of what VST&rsquo;s task should be: it should help to inform the theological imagination of our students for the 21st century &ldquo;so that they can give voice to thoughtful, engaged, and generous Christian faith for the love of God and for the sake of the world.&rdquo; Listening to his talk, I recalled hearing a remark that such people are &ldquo;able to speak five words with the mind.&rdquo; Richard&rsquo;s sentence is a bit longer than five words, but not by much&mdash;in fact, its central words are exactly five: &ldquo;thoughtful, engaged, and generous Christian faith.&rdquo; In our age of sound bites, which are often not mindful and of tomes of rhetoric which are seldom economical, one appreciates how rare and significant brief, thoughtful words are about anything important (and especially about God!).</p>
<p>Richard&rsquo;s pointing to the theological imagination is a key to the kind of words he has in mind when he attempts to sum up VST&rsquo;s mission. &ldquo;Imaginative&rdquo; language is not the same, old language that forms the conventional world in which we daily live. In several of my writings I call such imaginative language &ldquo;wild space.&rdquo; &ldquo;Wild space&rdquo; is the term that a couple of anthropologists use to express the hope that we all have deep within us that &ldquo;things could be different.&rdquo; At heart it is what most religions are about, summed up by almost universal agreement that, in different ways, they all agree: love your neighbor as yourself. Religions are counter-cultural, appealing to that crack in each of us that allows us to see, to imagine, a different, better vision of how we should&mdash;and can&mdash;live together on a more just, flourishing planet. The NGO&rsquo;s put it this way: &ldquo;a different world is possible,&rdquo; and Christians talk about the kingdom of God coming on earth. Richard says that a theologically-educated imagination can make a people so turned around by its vision &ldquo;that they grow discontent with what is, and start living toward more humane arrangements, where justice and peace embrace.&rdquo; And such theological reflection is done in a context that is thoughtful, engaged, and generous&mdash;three words that call for much further reflection.</p>
<p>In summary, when people call for action, they need to think about words. Words are actions for human beings. &ldquo;Sticks and stones can break my bones, but names will never hurt me.&rdquo; This is a lie. What we do is largely determined by the &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; within which we live and believe. These &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; are partly given to us and partly created by us. Things can be different but we have to help make them so, and our secret partner in all our actions are the assumptions within which we act. Richard is calling us to work as Christians with all others who imagine different, better &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; for all God&rsquo;s creatures. I believe that is vision worth working toward.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">The Future of Theological Education at VST</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/leaves.jpg"/>

<h3>Welcome to the Principal&rsquo;s blog. What we intend to do with the blog is bring you into the life and work of VST and bring the life and work of VST into the wider world.</h3>
<p>A variety of our professorial staff as well as guest bloggers will write here. We want to make the life of our school more broadly available. We&rsquo;re going to write about challenging trends in church life, offer insights into books that changed lives, let you know about the research we&rsquo;re up to and the difference that it makes to the church and the world as well as resource your work in preaching and leading. We hope you will visit our post often!</p>
<p>As part of the interview process for the job of Principal at VST, I was asked to give a public lecture in February of 2013. The topic I was asked to address came in the form of a question: What is VST&rsquo;s role in the future of theological education? What follows is my attempt to begin to answer that question. Don&rsquo;t worry, blogs won&rsquo;t usually be this long. I offer what follows as an introduction and I welcome your thoughts on what I said!</p>
<p>&mdash; richardt@vst.edu</p>
<h2>What is VSTs Role in the Future of Theological Education?</h2>
<p>In preparation for this presentation, I did a little research. And as we Canadians know, the vast majority of the literature about theological education in North American, its future perils and opportunities, is actually about theological education in the United States, even if Canada is tucked in the title.</p>
<p>I have been pouring over this material, which makes little or no mention of theological education in our country. However, I started calling people in the wider world of theological education in the US and what did they say? A couple of them said, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re watching what you are doing in Canada.&rsquo; Why?</p>
<p>The word is that we are where they are headed. In some ways, Canadian theological institutions are the canary in the mine for theological education in North America! We are the test case to see if the air is breathable in the shafts of secularities.</p>
<p>Dan Alseshire (Executive Director of the Association of Theological Schools in U.S. and Canada) wrote an article in 2011, which was derived from a consultation with the Princeton Theological Seminary, and he imagines The Future of Theological Education: A Speculative Glimpse at 2032.</p>
<p>He argues that three dominant external factors will shape theological education and Christian ministry in the years to come. Let me summarize.</p>
<ol><li>There will be increased secularization. &lsquo;Culture has reassigned religion from a social role of culture-shaper to one that is more personal and private.&rsquo; Thus theological education will increasingly focus on the cultivation of Christian virtue and identity rather than shape public life.</li>
<li>There will be an ongoing demographic shift in population. This implies &lsquo;the changing of the racial/ethnic composition of churches and society [which] will challenge assumptions in theological education that reflect the culture vestiges of privilege.&rsquo; He expects that students of theology and Christian congregations will become more diverse &ndash; racially and culturally &ndash; with all that entails for the ecclesiastical discomfort of those currently at the levers.</li>
<li>There will continue to be numerical decline in the mainline Protestant churches. And this will create a potential crisis for enrollment numbers in theological colleges &lsquo;since enrollments are influenced by the number of positions available &ndash; fewer congregations will have full time clergy.&rsquo; This means that theological colleges will have perhaps more part-time students, dual vocations and that theological training might be extended to church leaders other than clergy for pragmatic reasons. Theologies of ministry will need to be rethought.</li>
</ol><p>As I read this list and convert it into Canadian currency, it turns out that it is 2032 in Canada, particularly here in Vancouver. We already are where American Theological Institutions imagine they will be. I think what this means is that VST (a school located in arguably the most secular of region of the country) is thrust into a leadership role. It is tough to lead however if we aren&rsquo;t facing forward. If my back is to the future, while I sentimentalize the past, what might be isn&rsquo;t getting my full attention. A person doesn&rsquo;t drive well looking out the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>In the <em>Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology</em>, Rosemary Chang makes the point: the most annoying sound in the world is &lsquo;whining.&rsquo; The loss of numbers and cultural prestige by mainline churches and theological institutions in Canada has produced its share of whining. We sometimes decry our losses and circulate romanticized versions of how it used to be.</p>
<p>While I think biblical lament is a healthy process, since it&rsquo;s about facing the truth of our situation and it avoids the twin perils of denial and despair, we ought to move through our losses to imagine new possibilities born of God and the Gospel. I remember lamenting, eh, whining to Professor Will Willimon about trying to be Christian in a culture where no one goes to church or reads the Bible. He said, &lsquo;well, it could be worse, you could be in Alabama where everyone goes to church.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As I think about the future of theological education at VST, I imagine lots of opportunities and challenges. The use of technologies that extend our reach to students will no doubt be important and the role of social media in the socialization of the students we get will have serious implications for pedagogy now and into the future. Today, however, I leave these to one side. I want to focus my remarks on what we might hope to accomplish by means of theological education in the immediate future of VST.</p>
<h4>1.&nbsp;We will offer theological education for prophetic engagement with culture that is not about privileged access to power but witness</h4>
<p>Let me explain by way of disagreement with Aleshire.</p>
<p>In his article on the future of theological education, Aleshire makes the point that in the nineteenth century, church leaders in North America were shaping culture as much as they were leading in their congregations. Theological education in those halcyon days of Christian cultural influence was aimed at shaping candidates to shape the broader culture. &lsquo;The power of theological education to shape the broader intellectual culture was a function of the public intellectual status that clergy enjoyed in that culture.&rsquo; Fair enough.</p>
<p>However, Aleshire goes on to indicate that because &lsquo;culture&rsquo; has decided that religion will not shape public life any more -&rsquo;not give it a seat at the table where the fundamental future of the culture is concerned,&rsquo; theological schools should and probably will increasing focus on Christian practices in congregations and parishes.</p>
<p>I do agree that theological schools should teach students in ways that enable them to instill Christian formation in congregations (I teach the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer and the Creed &ndash; that&rsquo;s catechesis). Ironically, however, I think that this sort of formation will broker a greater concern for the common good, for mission. How can you say the prayer &ndash; &lsquo;thy kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven&rsquo; let it seep into your life and not be moved to address disparity on earth? I can&rsquo;t imagine an inculcation of Christian identity through teaching, preaching and liturgy that isn&rsquo;t for the sake of the world that God so loves. Prophetic witness and speech and action in the public sphere are ingredient to the Gospel, even if secularism, in its fundamentalist forms, would like to police them out.</p>
<p>Just because Christian leaders are no longer the go to people for public policy doesn&rsquo;t mean the churches and their leaders ought to get all quietist. Let&rsquo;s face it on issues like pipelines and ecology, economics and justice, church and its leaders have a humanizing take and a grateful responsibility as disciples of Jesus Christ. We envision life in the detoxified kingdom of God, and it has a certain critical relation to the current arrangements. We believe the earth is the Lord&rsquo;s and the fullness thereof and so it matters what happens to the earth. And it&rsquo;s worth saying so, in public, often, even if it is annoying to those who would like, in good enlightenment fashion, to keep private faith out of public life. We can be witnesses without privileged access to power.</p>
<p>I think what this means for VST is a theological education that is inter-disciplinary and that encourages risk. That way we don&rsquo;t embarrass ourselves by turning out graduates that either can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t engage the issues with intelligence. I think Michael Jinkins, president of Louisville Seminary is right: one of the reasons for the failure, where it comes to the engagement with culture, is that too often Christian social witness has been either mean or ignorant. I think he might have also added cautious to that list.</p>
<p>Most traditional seminaries don&rsquo;t turn out church leaders that are public intellectuals because radical cultural engagement requires a repertoire of knowledge and skills acquired through exposure to multiple disciplines. I think VST with its liberal and liberationist protestant legacy, and with its openness to other faiths and First Nations voices, has potential to produce prophets. Speaking together with others who are also interested in human flourishing in our cultural common life has real strength. Working together with others who have been minority voices for a longer time, and managed to speak out of minority identity to majority culture, could teach us a great deal. That&rsquo;s our future now.</p>
<p>I think VST can and does and ought to inculcate a prophetic imagination that isn&rsquo;t singular and individualistic, but which graciously looks for partners as action gets taken in our cultural life of the good of the world that God so loves.</p>
<p>Strains of contemporary missional theology encourage Christians to expect that God is at work in the world and to understand the church as an instrument in God&rsquo;s mission to reconcile the world to Godself. The church is not the end point of the mission of God, but one of the means that God requisitions for the sake of the reign of God. Take that seriously and following Jesus will bring us into the company of all kinds of interesting partners depending on the issues.</p>
<h4>2. We will offer theological education for the kind of churches we actually have, but it will be rigorous, theological education!</h4>
<p>The bad conscience of theological schools and seminaries these days is that we can propose to train leaders for an institution that may not have a place for them when they graduate. This can be either because there aren&rsquo;t any positions to be had or because graduates are not suited to the positions or projects that there are.</p>
<p>In conversations with the leaders of church judicatories about graduates from theological schools they collectively wonder out loud whether seminaries and theological colleges actually get the crisis going on in mainline Protestantism. They wonder out loud about the monopoly that churches have given seminaries and theological colleges. They are sometimes replacing what we do here with week-end seminars and workshops. Increasing numbers of our most vital congregations say theological education is out of touch. Students get lots of good ideas but often don&rsquo;t understand how to move and lead people.</p>
<p>Will Willimon notes, &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve got ideas, they lack initiative!&rsquo; Almost all of the mainline theological colleges in Canada have no training, for example, in how to start a congregation, a worshipping community. We used to be really good at this. As a theological professor and a Minister of the Gospel, I worry about our neglect in this regard.</p>
<p>It turns out that we can no longer suppose healthy congregations to which our graduates will go. Leaders in churches and in church related organizations are pressed these days. &lsquo;No longer do they need managers of decline; but entrepreneurial practioners and leaders of a transformational movement.&rsquo; As a friend of mine likes to put it: &lsquo;Mainline Churches who want to be part of God&rsquo;s future need leadership by impatient instigators rather than patient caretakers of the status quo&rsquo; (Will Willimon).</p>
<p>I know of bishops who no longer ask questions of candidates like: &lsquo;what are your gifts and graces for ministry&rsquo; &ndash; as it turns out everybody is gifted and graced; but rather, &lsquo;when is the last time you started a ministry?&rsquo; Tell us about your most recent failure in church? What did you learn?&rsquo; (Willimon, &lsquo;Ministry, Difficult as it Ought to Be&rsquo;).</p>
<p>I wonder if we need to begin to use a different analogy than various departments of graduate studies for the theological college (that&rsquo;s been the dominant model since at least the 19th century). It might be helpful to think of the medical school as an analogy. In medical school deep and difficult and disciplined learning takes place for the sake of a practice; of participation in something salvific, life-saving, transformative. Lives depend on how well you listen and learn and perform your craft and do your research.</p>
<p>Theological education is for the sake of sharing in the ongoing work of a God&rsquo;s work in our world. It is all about following the God who&rsquo;s doing something about what&rsquo;s wrong with the world. It is about the willingness to discover that the Gospel is a great deal less serene that we might have imagined. Theological education will mean upset and surprise, being disconcerted about what it is at once a matter of bewilderment and delight. As I read the gospels, I can&rsquo;t remember Jesus ever saying to his disciples. &lsquo;O.K. guys, you&rsquo;ve finally got it just right, don&rsquo;t change a thing, just keep it like that forever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All of this has huge repercussions for our seeking candidates for ministry together with the churches and how we train them. Edwin Friedman, a Rabbi and leader in the family systems theory talked about &lsquo;adventurous leadership&rsquo; as opposed to anxious leadership; I like that notion very much.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think that week-end seminars and workshops as replacements for a theological education will prove very thin and perhaps disastrous. In the future of VST as I imagine it, we are going to have to make powerful arguments for why critical, imaginative and constructive formation in bible and theology and liturgy and pastoral practice and church history and inter-religious and indigenous studies are so important.</p>
<p>We can train people to read a script &ndash; liturgy and preaching can be written down, and sermons can be borrowed from the internet, with a little theological training a person could even learn to steal the good ones. However, there is no script for bringing to bear the deep wisdom of the Christian tradition on major calamities and struggles in our culture and in personal lives. We need faculty who do credible and meaningful research for the sake of passing on a faith chastened by critical reflection but fired by conviction. We need learned leadership in the theological college for the sake of learned leadership in our churches!</p>
<p>I get concerned about some of the talk about imagination that is found everywhere in church and leadership materials these days. I worry about it in the church because sometimes those who want to be imaginative have a very romantic idea of drawing all new directions and ideas out of the reservoir of their own subjectivity. I don&rsquo;t want a doctor who is all creativity! I don&rsquo;t want a surgeon who is just making it up as she goes along. Imagination works best when it is stoked by memory of what was. The best jazz musicians first learned scales, where the keys are! The most creative preachers know the deep structures of the text. To improvise, a person has got to undertake training and disciplined observation of the masters. And so we delve into what Christians before us have done and said and written to stoke memory in order to riff on texts and traditions for the challenges of our time.</p>
<p>I believe that stoking of memory through theological education is really important in secular Canada. Some students, occasionally even some professors!, have been so well colonized by secularity that they frame every problem and challenge that the church faces first of all in managerial or social scientific terms. While these are helpful disciplines, they do bracket out God to make sense of things. And that&rsquo;s called atheism. Our work as a Theological College is to make sure we actually have a subject matter than matters to all our work. Our vocation is to train church leader&rsquo;s to read the world and the church in the world theologically, as though our decisive context is <em>corem deo</em> &ndash; before God, because it is.</p>
<p>I like the job description for a congregational minister I saw recently. One of the competencies expected was: &rsquo;The ability to minister the Word of God in a variety of circumstances.&rsquo; To do that it takes more than the ability to read a text; a person would need to be able to read life by means of the gospel; reframe imaginatively what is going on in terms of the life-giving stories of scripture; nurture a deep life with God. This spiritual skill set is similar to what Aristotle called <em>phronesis</em> &ndash; deep practical wisdom born not just of information acquisition but of life experience, meditation, discernment, conversation, holy friendship, the cultivated capacity to listen and pay attention.</p>
<p>For the future of VST, I think the question of how we attract students with these gifts in the making, educate them to becomes visionary leaders and maximize their ongoing potential to take risks for the sake of the Kingdom of God is a pressing one. It may be that we will need ongoing support for graduates once they commence their work, identifying best practices congregations where reliable and live-giving examples are embodied; it could mean that VST together with our denominational partners starts a new congregation for real life experience to the mutual benefit of college, student and church. If we&rsquo;re going to talk missional church and emergent church, maybe we need to be from Missouri &ndash; the &lsquo;show me&rsquo; state. It might also add some more credibility to our ecumenical commitments if we did it together.</p>
<h4>3. We will offer theological education that includes apologetics and inculcates skill in communication</h4>
<p>My brightest students, and they are all bright, have always made me aware, sometimes painfully, that the way we talk in a theological college is not the way most people talk. Post-modernism has taught us, I think, that there is no one language that we all speak; and that there is no religious or theological Esperanto. I quite like the Spanish American philosopher George Santaya, who said, &lsquo;it is as possible to be religious in general as it is to speak language in general.&rsquo; There are particular religions and there are particular languages. No one says, &ldquo;could you speak a little language, please?&rdquo; but rather <em>parle vous francais</em>.</p>
<p>However, I do sometimes worry about the effect of immersing our students into the specialized languages of theological study. Of course, a student of theology and religion needs to enter into the critical conversations about these topics. Of course, like all disciplines we have local languages that are a part of our disciplines. And, of course, language about God requires special consideration since we&rsquo;re always stretching and bending language to gesture to a reality that we never control but that graciously gives itself to be known.</p>
<p>And yet, I think it is a sobering question to ask whether students are also taught to communicate to a public that no longer has a residual memory of things religious or Christian. Charles Taylor, a Canadian Philosopher, wrote the Templeton Prize winning book entitled, A Secular Age, and in that book he makes the case that people in this part of the world mostly live in an &lsquo;immanent frame.&rsquo; What that means is that language about God is a kind of foreign language, and even when grasped, is regarded as an irrelevance, or an extravagant way of talking about ourselves.</p>
<p>I think VST has a role in forming students in such a way that they are able to communicate in this kind of context. It may be that the historic discipline, apologetics, that used to be taught in our seminaries, needs a creative recovery. By this term, I mean an engagement with our time and place that involves clear and declarative sentences, an understanding of the intersections between culture and gospel where conversation might be interesting and life-giving.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Stout, a Princeton ethicist, said a few years back, that reading some modern theologians is somewhat akin to going to hear a speech, and listening to the speaker clear his or her throat for twenty minutes. Sometimes education breeds anxiety about saying anything about God or the Gospel. After three subordinate clauses the net value of the sentence is zero.</p>
<p>In this regard I have learned a great deal from my students who&rsquo;ve demanded a little more clarity, repeated what I awkwardly stated in the language of the theological guild with the preface, &ldquo;so what you&rsquo;re trying to say is . . .&rdquo; And then they communicated. I hope that whatever the value added of a theological education at VST, we aim to communicate to students in ways that leverage their communication in this time and place.</p>
<p>The places where language about God is still operative in our culture, according to Taylor, is in the realms of beauty and ethics. People experience something greater than their own little lives when beauty presents itself. Augustine says if you contemplate beauty it can take up a staircase to the ultimate beauty that is God. And even our post-modern contemporaries still want to believe that love and justice are not arbitrary. Interestingly more and more missional and emergent churches meet in art galleries and theatres &ndash; connecting these common places of beauty and everyday life with the worship of God . . .</p>
<p>In conclusion: I offer a poem, written by Jill Baumgaertner. It was written as she returned to life having suffered the death of her godson. I think her words are instructive and life-giving, for churches and church institutions who lament the losses of Christendom, but who turn back to life from loss:</p>
<h2>Benedictus</h2>
<p>We turn back to our lives,<br>
plot lines altered,<br>
palimpsests: characters erased,<br>
We will never be the same.<br>
Burned clean of illusion,<br>
we face the cross,<br>
finding there the exacting cost of grace.<br>
We lift our faces to the softer light<br>
we sense beyond the treetop shadows.<br>
We step into the path,<br>
thick with fallen leaves,<br>
the earth beneath sheltering<br>
the tight fists of bloom<br>
spring will uncurl.</p>

<h3>The Native Ministries Consortium, founded in 1985, marks thirty years of partnership with a pledge to continue shaping the terms of our relationship.</h3>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">This news item relates to the raising of the pole &lsquo;All My Relations&rsquo; outside of the Iona Building on the UBC campus, that took place on July 6, 2006.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>It is appropriate that we make this commitment today as we raise the &ldquo;All My Relations&rdquo; pole at Vancouver School of Theology. For North Coast First Nations people, a totem pole symbolized history, identity and governance. For the Native Ministries Consortium, this pole symbolizes our mutual determination to carry on and strengthen the heritage of co-operation and co-existence which has affected both First Nations Christians and theological education for the past two decades.</p>
<p>We ask those present to witness the pole raising to see also the Consortium partners&rsquo; commitment to define clearly the nature of this unique, intercultural and international partnership and to live into it with integrity. Specific areas of focus include consultation, accountability, sustainability, inclusion and the sharing of power, authority and voice. In all our efforts, we will honour and give priority to the diversity of First Nations cultural practices.</p>
<p>We thank all who have honoured our invitation to be present today and witness this pledge.</p>
<p>We thank our Creator, who gives us generosity of spirit and hospitality of place.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Context: The Hazards of a Good Idea</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Abel_Grimmer_-_De_toren_van_Babel.jpg"/>

<h2>Douglas John Hall[1]</h2>
<p>There is no such thing as Christian theology without risks. Every good theological idea has its attendant hazards. It is the mark of theological maturity to realize this about one&rsquo;s own theological work, and to cultivate foresight about the ways in which one&rsquo;s convictions may be misused.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">1.</h3>
<p>First, let me reaffirm why I think that contextuality in Christian theology is indeed a &lsquo;good idea&rsquo;&ndash;in fact, an essential one. Permit me to speak about this autobiographically.[2] In the 1960s when I began to think and write with a deliberate view to the importance of our North American context, the terms &lsquo;context&rsquo; and &lsquo;contextuality&rsquo; were rarely used in theological work. More importantly, apart from Reinhold Niebuhr, the specificity of our own Canadian and American contexts didn&rsquo;t seem to matter much in what theologians wrote and talked about. One could take the latest theologies from elsewhere&mdash;mostly Europe&mdash;and, with a slight twist of the wrist, apply them to us.</p>
<p>My friend the late George P. Grant, Canada&rsquo;s most insightful philosophic analyst of our &lsquo;New World&rsquo;, stated the matter succinctly:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a field as un-american as theology, the continually changing ripples of thought, by which the professionals hope to revive a dying faith, originate from some stone dropped by a European thinker.[3]</p></blockquote>
<p>The late Sixties provided a stunning example of precisely this North American habit of borrowing our theologies ready-made from the sufferings of others. Juergen Moltmann&rsquo;s brilliant Theology of Hope was published in an English translation during Canada&rsquo;s centennial year.[4] This book had been received in Moltmann&rsquo;s Germany as a beacon of light after decades of crushing defeat, social despondency and the repressive rhetoric (Dorothee Soelle called it &ldquo;lying&rdquo;) of post-War politics. The book&rsquo;s 39-year-old author was himself, as a German soldier and prisoner of war, just emerging from the personal humiliations of the war. Like some of my other German friends, Moltmann was able, despite his former indifference to the Christian religion, to find in the gospel of The Crucified God[5] hope for a people that had experienced great failure and shame.</p>
<p>Knowing something of the rather vast difference between the German and the North American situations, I watched carefully to see what was made of Moltmann&rsquo;s Theology of Hope in Canada and the U.S.A. Alas, it was predictable. We like &lsquo;hope&rsquo;. Hope is uplifting. Hopeful people are nice. So this latest &ldquo;ripple of thought&rdquo; coming from Germany, the homeland of Great Theology, made a huge impact here. Everywhere there were conferences and symposia and lectures on the &lsquo;theology of hope.&rsquo; I seriously doubt that very many North American Christians (including professionals!) actually read Moltmann&rsquo;s difficult book. The slogan was enough!</p>
<p>The contextual difference between defeated Germany and triumphant Americana was immense: for Germans the theology of hope was gospel because they had known hope&rsquo;s antithesis, despair; for North Americans this theology just postponed any real confrontation with our deeply repressed despair. What was Good News for many Germans was in North America just another phase of the old religion&mdash;the religion of progress and optimism. Contexts matter!</p>
<p>Observing the strange fate of Moltmann&rsquo;s Theologie der Hoffnung in our context drove me to publish my first serious essay, which I called &ldquo;The Theology of Hope in an Officially Optimistic Society&rdquo;[6]. I have been guided in all my subsequent work by the realization that dialogue with our socio-cultural context is the condition without which Christian theology, in the authentic sense of the term, cannot be done.[7]</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">2.</h3>
<p>However, to repeat: There is no non-risky theology. And in our &ldquo;officially optimistic society&rdquo;, whose rhetorical optimism is driven by capitalist economic logic as well as recurring versions of the much-battered &lsquo;American Dream&rsquo; and its pale Canadian counterpart, the hazards of contextual theology become conspicuous. For the past three or four decades, &lsquo;context&rsquo; and &lsquo;contextuality&rsquo; have become buzz-words, almost clich&eacute;s. That in itself is enough to kill a good idea; but there are two especially hazardous uses of contextuality that I want to name here:</p>
<p>First, there is a tendency to define context too narrowly and parochially. Too many Christians seem to think in decades, when we should be thinking about epochs or long, deep-seated historical trends. Authentically contextual thinking assumes historical knowledge. Others believe they are thinking contextually when they identify the cultural context that Christian theology need to engage with some particular &ldquo;issue&rdquo; (sexual issues are especially popular), some moral or political cause, some quest for &lsquo;identity.&rsquo; Such matters are of course aspects of the context in which Christians find themselves today. But they are for the most part consequences&mdash;effects&ndash;of deeper problems. Authentic contextuality looks for causes.</p>
<p>There are of course contexts within contexts. There are indeed particular socio-economic, racial, ethnic and gender &lsquo;issues&rsquo; that all serious Christians must try to comprehend and address. Every area in Canada, every province (I live in Quebec!), every age-group, every community has its own specific challenges and possibilities. When it comes to that, every individual lives in a context that is unique. Good preachers and pastors have always known this.</p>
<p>But with all our specific contexts, great or small, we are all living in a globalized context that tends to erase ancient cultures, we are all part of a technologically-driven society that discourages thought, we are all conditioned by an economic system that creates poverty for the majority of earth&rsquo;s peoples. Most importantly, we are all living on a planet, perhaps unique in the universe, whose future is profoundly threatened. If we identity our &lsquo;context&rsquo; too narrowly with its parts, or some of them, our Christian witness becomes so diffuse and discordant that Christianity will appear more like Babel than Pentecost! Some would say that this has already happened.</p>
<p>The hazard of contextual narrowness, however, goes beyond the habit of identifying our context with specific social and moral and other aspects of the context. Of course Christians are called to address particular questions of human and creaturely well-being, but we are required to listen for the questions beneath the questions, the anxieties beneath the anxieties, the ontological plate-shifting beneath the surface of society. In a word, the context that theology has to try to understand is the moving spirit&mdash;Geist&mdash;of the culture we want to engage. What is the spiritual condition of this time and place&mdash; its Zeitgeist? That is what Jesus was talking about when he said to the most &lsquo;religious&rsquo; leaders of his context, &ldquo;&rsquo;You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times.&rdquo; [Matthew 16:3] The Spirit of God drives faith to become acquainted with this other spirit, the spirit of the times. When these two spirits meet (and only then), something worthy of the term theology may happen.</p>
<p>The second (and more important) concern that I have about our present &lsquo;contextual-ism&rsquo; is that for too many of our contemporaries &lsquo;the context&rsquo; seems to constitute the whole of the matter. Many appear to believe that if, as a Christian, you have spoken interestingly (perhaps in stained-glass accents) about &lsquo;the context&rsquo; you have done your job. But context is only one side of the dialectic in which Christians are called to live and work. The other side of the dialectic can be variously called &lsquo;the Christian message&rsquo; (Tillich), &lsquo;the tradition&rsquo;, &lsquo;the gospel&rsquo;, etc. In other words, it refers to what Christians bring to their context.</p>
<p>Both components are essential. It is not theology if there is no contextual agonizing, and it is not theology if there is no (or only superficial) wrestling with what has been &lsquo;handed over&rsquo; (tradere &ndash;tradition). Karl Barth&rsquo;s well-known bon mot is instructive: &ldquo;The Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the other.&rdquo; But Barth didn&rsquo;t mean just the Bible (though he did give the scriptures priority), and he certainly didn&rsquo;t mean just The Globe or the N.Y. Times!</p>
<p>Christians who have not struggled to understand their own context end by either perpetuating the truisms of past contexts or by mouthing religious or ethical generalizations that could be articulated by any thinking person. But Christians who have not subjected their minds to the long traditions of theological thought, including the Christian and Hebrew Scriptures, end by having nothing much to bring to their contexts by way of another perspective, another possibility&mdash;maybe even something &lsquo;new&rsquo;: Good News!</p>
<p>So Christian theology is never easy. From the experience of six decades attempting it, I can say, with feeling, that theology is often agonizing. One does it on the verge of failure always&mdash;and especially today, when the &lsquo;social nets&rsquo; that made theology, ministry and even faith itself seem &lsquo;natural&rsquo; have all been removed. Trying to live between honest intellectual and spiritual exposure to our times (such times!) and vigorous, continuous and deep probing of the Judeo-Christian tradition is very hard work. Many who &lsquo;put their hand to the plough&rsquo; give up after a few years; others find more comfortable ways of being &lsquo;Christian&rsquo;, &lsquo;ministers&rsquo;, &lsquo;theologians.&rsquo; One shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard on them. They&rsquo;ve discovered that one could be crucified living between the Zeitgeist and the holy Geist! Many (like Dietrich Bonhoeffer) have been. But that&rsquo;s where theology is called to live. It is never without risk, and never without something like . . . suffering.</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not all it is.</p>

<h1 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Convocation for the Induction of Principal Richard Topping</h1>
<img class="size-full" src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/themes/vst/img/lazy.jpg" data-src="http://vst.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1379816_10151948903565071_328816774_n.jpg"/>

<h2>Convocation for Induction of Principal</h2>
<p>Students, staff, Alumni, Friends and Faculty, Board of Governors, Madam Chair and esteemed Chancellor.</p>
<p>What an honour to be inducted as the 7th Principal of the Vancouver School of Theology today. My time as Principal, I am sure, will not be like the 7th day of creation &ndash; that is a day of rest &ndash; from what I can see so far.</p>
<p>However, to be seventh, at pretty much anything, is a reminder that others have preceded you in the work you do. In the most immediate history of the school I follow Wendy Fletcher and Stephen Farris, and I am glad. Because of their courageous and diligent work my efforts have tracks in which to run. In the short three months of my own time as Principal, I have blessed their names for the good things I have inherited due to them. Thank you both for your faithful legacy and for your ongoing kindness and support to VST and to me.</p>
<p>I am also especially grateful to those who planned this service and the liturgy &ndash; David McMillan, Shannon Lythgoe, Richard Leggett, Margaret Trim and Anita Fast. I am also so very grateful to Our Chancellor Peter Elliot, the Chair of the Board, Heather Clarke and to our preacher for today, Darrell Guder, who have made this occasion so memorable, inspiring and deeply moving. And I am grateful to my family whose love and support, too often taken for granted, sustains me.</p>
<p>One of my favorite authors, Northrop Fyre, a Canadian literary scholar, gave the Massey Lectures on CBC in 1963. The Educated Imagination, is now in its twenty-fifth printing. In this book Frye asks a simple question: why study literature? His answer is rich with possibility. He says that the study of literature, what he calls &ndash; &lsquo;man&rsquo;s revelation to man&rsquo; &ndash; is for the sake of funding imagination. Literary studies are hard work. They require critical finesse and directed attention, but the goal is to beef-up imagination.</p>
<p>Frye claims that if imagination is stoked (educated) with ideas from other times and places, you quickly realize that what&rsquo;s served up by your culture right now is only one way of doing things. There are better worlds than the one around us right now; there are worlds we want to live in. And imagination could lead to action. When you compare what is with what might be, it could make us so restless with the dead-ends and stale leftovers of the present that whole communities could start living toward a better arrangement, a more humane option, a possible world.</p>
<p>Now I wonder, if Frye&rsquo;s way of putting it, might be jazzed into a theological frame.&nbsp;What about a theologically educated imagination? What about theological education as focused critical attention on &lsquo;God&rsquo;s revelation to people&rsquo; in Jesus Christ in the power of the Spirit. After all Frye was a United Church Minister, he&rsquo;s always talking about the power of scripture.</p>
<p>Could whole communities dare (by faith) to envision what might be because the Triune God has stoked their imaginations through prophets and poets, scripture and saints testifying to the Kingdom coming on earth as it is in heaven. A theologically educated imagination may envision a reconciled world, fueled as it is with visions of lions and lambs lying down together, with visions of swords beat into plowshares, of a detoxified heaven and earth through the Lamb that was slain. A people could become so enamoured with these solicitous visions that they grow discontent with what is, and start living toward more humane arrangements, where justice and peace embrace. And they do it not because they have to but because they may.</p>
<p>Subject yourself to theological education as imaginative transformation and priorities could get reversed, altered, changed. Fund an imagination with the Gospel of reconciliation and the next thing you know someone says, &ldquo;I have a dream . . . &rdquo; and then audacious people &ndash; like Martin Luther King Jr. move non-violently toward a more humane arrangement. They just start to believe that history bends toward justice! Talk about grasped by a vision!</p>
<p>If UBC is &ldquo;A place of Mind;&rdquo; What about VST as &lsquo;A place of Imagination.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is a difference between imaginative and imaginary thinking. One is funded with critical care, engaged with the world and works with partners; imaginary thinking can be naive utopian thinking that hovers at 50,000 feet. Imaginary thinking gives us claustrophobic individualistic visions.</p>
<p>The imaginative theological formation that we do and will do at VST is thoughtful, engaged and generous in its work. In our theological education we are thoughtful. We interrogate naive visions that are thin and reactionary and leave most people out of view.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more our work is way too important to do in a single week-end. We&rsquo;re looking for a quality of leadership that best serves the gospel and world. And so we take the time to lay down the rudiments of the theological keyboard so that our students can eventually play doxological jazz in a whole variety of circumstances.<br>
We&rsquo;re thoughtful because the world is full of instances of thoughtless faith, of mean and stupid faith, of dangerous and superstitious faith. And if there is one thing we have in common with atheists, it is this &ndash; we know the danger of bad ideas about God.</p>
<p>Great harm comes to the world through superstition and hatred and so we linger and contemplate and attend to the details. We are not interested in promoting ignorance and fear in the place of piety. At VST we work hard at seeking understanding so that we&rsquo;ve got a thick description of a profound faith for deep engagement with the world.</p>
<p>Michael Jinkins, one of the bright lights in theological education says,&nbsp;&ldquo;There have been few moments in Christianity&rsquo;s history when more was at stake than at this moment. There have been few moments in Christianity&rsquo;s history when we have needed a thinking faith, a theologically reflective faith, a generous and critical, imaginative and deeply engaged faith more than we do today.&rdquo; (The Church Transforming, 92).</p>
<p>In the formation of theological imagination, we also want to engage the world and the big issues of our time. I think Karl Barth was right that theology ought to be done with the Bible in one hand and the newspaper in the other (although I am pretty sure he didn&rsquo;t mean we give equal weight to the National Post and Romans in our thinking about God).</p>
<p>Why engage with the world? because God is engaged with the world, because God so loves the world. God is at work in the world, God is always already active making and keeping human life human &ndash; there are little lights and parables of the love of God scattered all over the place if we will attend to the world. If we really believe that, and if we are imaginatively attentive to the world in which the suffering God is at work, we will discern what our work needs to be. If God got downwardly mobile to touch the world in Jesus of Nazareth, God&rsquo;s people need to follow God into the world; ours is no arm chair religion &ndash; endlessly spinning our wheels in analysis paralysis.<br>
Doug Hall in his new book, What Christianity is Not, says that the important question is not what are we the church doing but what is God doing and how do we get with God&rsquo;s mission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The question the church (and theological colleges) ought to be asking and seeking to answer in and for a particular time and place (context) is not what should we do, but rather where is God now at work making and keeping life human? The extent to which [we] determine an answer or answers to that question will determine the nature and relevance of our own activity&rsquo; (Douglas John Hall, <em>What Christianity is Not</em>, 122).</p>
<p>Finally in our theological education, we are generous. And here I mean generous as the opposite of narrow and sectarian. While we love the church and actually believe the church to be an agent of God&rsquo;s love in the world, we keep our eyes open for partners in our mission &ndash; including other Christians.</p>
<p>And the truth in our multi-religious, multi-cultural context is that we have a whole range of partners. Jesus taught us to love, not to fear or compete with our neighbours. It is a wonderful thing: to go deep in Christian faith is to go wide in the neighbourhood. I have yet to read the story in the gospels where Jesus says, &ldquo;go out there and prove other religions wrong.&rdquo; Instead when the disciples object to someone who heals outside the official card carrying Jesus movement, Jesus says, &lsquo;if they aren&rsquo;t against us, they are for us.&rsquo; It was Jesus&rsquo; disciples, not Jesus, who got all proprietary about healing.</p>
<p>Miroslav Volf in his book, <em>A Public Faith, How Followers of Christ Should Serve the Common Good</em> (p. 129) says that each dynamic faith tradition overlaps with others, and so there&rsquo;s hope of profound cooperation for the good of the world &ndash; on issues like violence and ecology.</p>
<p>(&lsquo;The dynamic character of each religion and the overlaps between them give some reason to hope that the perspectives of various people of faith need not always clash, or need not always clash fruitlessly, and that when the perspectives do clash, the people who hold them need not be mired in endless violence.&rsquo;)</p>
<p>I know that religions aren&rsquo;t all the same &ndash; a Muslim friend helped me understand that. However there is often &lsquo;overlapping consensus&rsquo; on the issues of our time that we can address for the good of the world with other folks of good will. We can learn from our first nations and neighbours of other faiths, but we will need to know each other well enough to do so for the sake of more humane arrangements in the world; that&rsquo;s why ISC and IP are important petals on the VST flower &ndash; the logo of our school. Christians reach out to the world for the love of the God revealed in Jesus Christ, others have their own particular reasons, but we can be generous &ndash; not narrow and exclusionary &ndash; in our work in and for the mending of God&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p>Friends, at VST we want to cultivate a community where hospitality and generosity of spirit are the norm. The root of this generosity is our baptismal identity in Christ, who calls us to love our neighbours unconditionally, without fear; to learn from our neighbours without anxiety and to act with and for our neighbours with integrity.</p>
<p>I think VST is uniquely positioned to form theological imagination in the lives of our students for this our time. And we do it so that they can give voice to thoughtful, engaged and generous Christian faith for the love of God and for the sake of the world.</p>
