						<p>Bala Library's History</p>
					</div>
					<div class="body01">
					  <p>Information  is scarce as to when the first library started in Bala. It is known that many  of the early settlers brought a collection of books with them. E.B. Sutton  brought his own personal library to Bala when he emigrated in 1882. Apart from  building the Bala Bay Inn in 1912, he was a prolific writer and historian until  his death in 1917.</p>
						<p>Thomas  Burgess who started the first school, the first church, the first general store  and a saw mill, no doubt contributed to the literacy in the community of which  he was a founder.<br />
						  It  is known that the Women's Institute did tremendous work in the community and  shared their books with anyone interested. Initially the books were kept in  private homes, particularly in the home of the Gowland family.</p>
						<p>In  those early days great credit must be given to Edna Templeton and Ruth Stainer  Orchard for their endless work and enthusiasm in establishing a small library  in the Bala Public School under the direction of Jess Johnston. This is home to  the Bala Legion today. Through the 1950s the library flourished until the  school moved to Glen Orchard. Once again the Women's Institute were responsible  for finding space in the United Church building.</p>
						<p>Finally,  the library moved to the Community Centre in 1970 and continued to be well  supported by the Women's Institute. The space was very limited, however, and  far from ideal. In 1994 an addition was built to the Community Centre and this  is where the library stands today with Mrs. Mari Carson as librarian. This  branch has a wonderful selection of current adult fiction, a large children's  selection, an internet connected computer, and wifi &nbsp;available for public  use. The selection of books continues to grow with added support from the  community and an annual generous financial donation from the Cranberry  Festival.</p>
