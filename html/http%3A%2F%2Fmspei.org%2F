<h2>Island physicians recognized for excellence</h2>

<p>Based on a multitude of nominations from across the Island, three Island physicians were recognized for excellence at a ceremony held last night.

<p>In October of this year, the Medical Society of PEI, in partnership with the Canadian Medical Foundation, launched its P1 Awards – Physicians Putting Patients First – program.

<p>Islanders responded immediately and enthusiastically to the invitation to laud physicians who deliver consistent and excellent care and who have had an impact on their lives and the lives of their loved ones. In total, 107 nominations were received for 47 different physicians in this Patients’ Choice Award category.

<p>Following careful review, the Selection Committee identified Dr. Hal McRae as the inaugural  winner of the Patients’ Choice Award.

<p>“The level and depth of nominations for Dr. McRae really stood out,” said Dr. David Bannon, Past President  and Chairman of the Medical Society Board of Directors. “His patients say he exceeds the expectations they have of their physician and is even described as ‘truly being part of our family.’” 

 

<p>According to patients, he goes out of his way – even sometimes driving considerable distances – to provide them with the medical attention they need. They especially note his willingness to review non-invasive options and alternatives to medication with them. He is depicted as being genuine, caring, compassionate, polite, respectful and knowledgeable and is lauded for his concern for his patients, the Prince County Hospital, and overall medical care on PEI.

 

<p>The other two P1 Awards – the President’s Leadership Award and the Community Service Award -- were peer-nominated.

<p>Dr. Greg German, winner of the President’s Leadership Award was recognized by his peers for consistently going above and beyond in his microbiologist role and for being the ultimate “go to” person in the field of infectious disease. 

<p>“In addition to leading or contributing to several important initiatives, Dr. German is an invaluable clinical resource for other physicians, providing expert infectious disease advice and support,” said Dr. Jill Cunniffe, President of the Medical Society of PEI. “Although he has only been practicing on the Island for about two years, his impact has indeed been system- and province-wide and he has also been active on the national front.”

<p>The Community Service Award recognizes the important role doctors play in their village, town, city or indeed the province as a whole.  This year, the honour went to Charlottetown physician Dr. David MacKenzie.

<p>“If PEI is hosting a national-level sporting event, there is a great chance that Dr. MacKenzie is involved.  The same goes for varsity or provincial sports teams – or for recreational-level sports for that matter,” said colleague Dr. Alf Morais. “Yet, despite a busy practice, high involvement in sports medicine, and participation in youth and music ministry at his church, David is very family-oriented and maintains a healthy work-life balance.  Further, his personal emphasis on fitness and well-being is both impressive and inspiring to colleagues, friends and members of his community.”

<p>The Medical Society was very pleased with the number and calibre of nominations received and is already making plans for next year. 

<p>“Given the way Islanders came forward to laud their physicians, the P1 Awards program has proven an effective means to recognize, celebrate and inspire excellence in the medical community,” said President Dr. Jill Cunniffe.
