discover if you are new, and even if you have been here for a long time, to the scene.
<br>Part of our new strategy to be a welcoming and inclusive community is to have people available on Sunday to answer questions and help people find their way within our midst so that people feel welcome. Fear not! We are not looking for experts, we are looking for people who enjoy meeting people, who enjoy having conversations and helping others, and who are passionate about this church.
<br>We know that availability differs for most people, so the more people involved the better! Please join us for this training session and then decide if this is something you would like to do. 
<br>All ages are welcome and it doesn't matter if you have been at this church for 3 months or 30 years. If you have any questions feel free to talk with Rev. Karen Bridges
