URGENT ADVISORY FOR REGISTERED VOTERS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEIR BALLOTS 
The Philippine Embassy in Ottawa has mailed out all ballots to registered Filipino overseas voters under its consular jurisdiction, except for those who manifested the intention to vote in person.  Registered  voters residing in Ontario east of Kingston, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut who have not received their ballots are advised to check the following lists and take note of accompanying instructions.
 




1.    Voters who cannot be located by the Embassy due to defective addresses in their overseas voter registration records


They may vote in person according to the COMELEC-authorized schedule below.




2.     Voters whose ballots were previously mailed by the Embassy but were returned to sender by Canada Post due to incomplete or change of address


They may email the Embassy to request that their election packet be mailed to their correct or present address, subject to COMELEC approval.  They also have the option to vote in person according to the COMELEC-authorized schedule below.




3.    Registered voters who have not received their respective ballot packets by mail but are not listed among those with defective addresses or those whose ballots have been returned to the Embassy


They may contact their nearest Post Office or the occupants of their old address for any misrouted mail.
They may also call the Embassy at 613.233.1121 for further guidance.




Verification measures are in place such that the Special Board of Election Inspectors (SBEI) will only count one ballot per voter.

President of the Philippines
On the terror activities of the Abu Sayyaf
[Released on April 27, 2016]
Yesterday, I sent a letter to the family of John Ridsdel expressing our condolences. We are so appalled by this murder. Mr. Ridsdel was a person against whom no one had any grievance-a person who was powerless against his captors. This murder was meant to terrorize our whole population. The Abu Sayyaf thought they could instill fear in us; instead, they have galvanized us even further to ensure justice is meted out. We have always been open to talks with those who desire peace; but those who commit atrocities can expect the full might of the State.
I am ready to devote all my energies towards ensuring that, at the very least, this will be a very seriously degraded problem that I will pass on to my successor.
Let me take this opportunity to explain the current efforts against the Abu Sayyaf.
Since its founding in the early 1990s, allegedly as an affiliate of Al-Qaeda, the Abu Sayyaf has committed atrocity upon atrocity. There was the sacking of Ipil in 1995, the bombing of Davao International Airport in 2003, and multiple cases of kidnapping foreign tourists over the past decade and a half. Their actions speak for themselves. Even as it poses as a group of Islamic freedom fighters, the Abu Sayyaf has behaved as criminals focused on enriching themselves by taking hostages for ransom.
ASG and various smaller terrorist groups and factions now want to align themselves with ISIS to gain access to the funds and resources of ISIS. From Day One of my administration, they have had aspirations to conduct bombings in Metro Manila to catch the attention of ISIS. May I emphasize that these have been, and remain, only aspirations.
As part of their effort to gain favor with ISIS, one of the ASG leaders, Isnilon Hapilon, through his cohorts in prison, has tried to convert other prisoners in New Bilibid Prison to their cause and establish ties with remnants of the Rajah Sulayman Movement purportedly in an attempt to embark on a bombing campaign in Metro Manila. They allegedly even hatched plots to kidnap Manny Pacquiao or one of his children, as well as my sister Kris or one of her children, with the plan to use them in bargaining for the release of their cohorts. Threats against my own life have been investigated.
No IEDs attributable to the group of Hapilon have been found. We have monitored their activities, unraveled their network, and arrested the key players, while some of the minor players who were already on the run are being hunted down. I credit our security services for putting these threats to bed with both professionalism and discretion. The public may rest assured that they may go about their daily lives without fear or unease.
However, we want to continue to seriously erode any ability of the ASG to continue to function.
This is the reason we are conducting continuing operations in Basilan versus Isnilon Hapilon and his sub-leader Furuji Indama.
As for the situation in Sulu: Our reports tell us that the captives are under the control of Radillon Sajiron, who has consolidated his forces around himself and the captives. This presents both a problem and an opportunity. It is a problem because of the sizeable force surrounding Sajiron and the captives, but it is also an opportunity because smashing these forces is within our grasp.
This is why intensive operations are ongoing against the ASG forces holding civilians captive in Sulu. The full resources of the State are being brought down on the ASG. Our primary objective is to rescue the hostages and ensure the safety of our civilian population. We will leave no stone unturned and are studying every instrument, both military and legal, to ensure success in our areas of operations and wherever else required.
Casualties are to be expected. But what has to be of utmost importance is neutralizing the criminal activities of the ASG. The men and women in our Armed Forces are well-trained, well-equipped, and resourceful. I have full trust and confidence in them.
We have proven before that we will choose all-out justice over all-out war. We have always believed in the power of dialogue, development, and positive engagement over arms. But we will always act from a position of strength. So, to the ASG, and whoever may aid or abet them, you have chosen only the language of force, and we will speak to you only in that language.
We will not stop until the threat they pose to our communities is ended.

  			<a title="President Benigno S. Aquino III on Wednesday vowed that the government will not stop until the threat posed by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) is ended.
"The full resources of the State are being brought down on the ASG. Our primary objective is to rescue the hostages and ensure the safety of our civilian population. We will leave no stone unturned and are studying every instrument, both military and legal, to ensure success in our areas of operations and wherever else required," he said in a statement.
The ASG beheaded Canadian mining executive John Ridsdel after the government failed to pay the P300 million ransom demanded by the bandits.
Ridsdel's severed head, which was inside a plastic bag dropped by two men on a motorcycle, was found by residents in Jolo town, five hours after the expiry of the ransom deadline set at 3 p.m. last Monday (April 25).
Ridsdel was among the four hostages who were abducted by ASG bandits on September 21 last year from a resort on Samal Island, Davao del Norte. Also seized were Canadian Robert Hall, Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, and Filipina Marithes Flor. According to reports, the group is also holding 14 Indonesians, four Malaysians, a Dutch, and a Japanese.
In his statement, the President said he had sent a letter to Ridsdel's family on Tuesday to express his condolences.
"We are so appalled by this murder... This murder was meant to terrorize our whole population.

  			<a title="Malacañang on Tuesday expressed its condolences to the Canadian government and the family of mining executive John Ridsdel, who was killed by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG).
Ridsdel was among the four hostages who were abducted by ASG bandits on September 21 last year from the Holiday Ocean View resort on Samal Island, Davao del Norte. Also seized were Canadian Robert Hall, Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, and Filipina Marithes Flor.
"We extend our deepest sympathy and condolences to the Canadian government and to the family of Mr. John Ridsdel, who died in the hands of the ASG bandits," Communication Secretary Herminio Coloma, Jr. said in a statement.
The ASG had threatened to behead one of the hostages on April 25 at 3 p.m. if the government fails to pay the ransom demanded by the bandits. The initial demand was P1 billion each for the hostages but the amount was reduced to P300 million.
Reports said the severed head of Ridsdel, which was inside a plastic bag dropped by two men on a motorcycle, was found by residents in the center of Jolo town, five hours after the expiry of the ransom deadline.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was outraged upon learning of the killing.
Secretary Coloma assured that military and law enforcement operations in Sulu will continue.
"There will be no let-up in the resolute efforts of the joint PNP-AFP task group in pursuing intensive and wide-ranging military and law enforcement operations to neutralize these lawless elements and thwart further threats to peace and security," he said, adding that President Benigno S. Aquino III "has directed the security forces to apply the full force of the law to bring these criminals to justice".
President Aquino on Monday ordered Acting Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief, Lt. Gen. Glorioso Miranda, and Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief, Director General Ricardo Marquez, to conduct appropriate military and law enforcement operations to rescue the four hostages.
The President also instructed local authorities to cooperate with the AFP-PNP Task Force and ensure the safety of citizens in the affected communities. PND (jm)

18 April 2016 - Manning overseas voting desks in Ottawa and a field voting outlet for the Maritime Provinces in Canada, the Philippine Embassy in Ottawa saw eager Filipinos casting their ballots in bigger numbers during the first 10 days of overseas voting for the 2016 national elections.
A total of 223 ballots have been cast by mail or in person from 9 April 2016 to 18 April 2016 or 78% more than ballots cast during the first 10 days of overseas voting for the 2013 national elections.
In Halifax, Nova Scotia where the Embassy conducted field voting on 15-16 April 2016, some Filipino voters even took a long drive from the neighboring provinces of Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick to deliver or cast their votes in person.   "Gusto kong iexercise ang right of suffrage ko. Baka may magbago," said Regor Gamarcha, a permanent resident of Halifax.  (I want to exercise my right of suffrage.  Something might change.)
With 20 more calendar days of continuous overseas voting to go, the Philippine Embassy expects a further surge in votes cast, especially during the week before 9 May 2016 when the voting period ends at 5:00 a.m.  Eastern Standard Time (EST) or 5:00 p.m. Philippine Standard Time (PST).
Aside from continuous voting from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily in Ottawa until 5:00 a.m. of 9 May 2016, the Philippine Embassy has also scheduled field voting days at the St. Kevin Parish Hall in Montreal on 22-23 April 2016, 29-30 April 2016 and 6-7 May 2016.
"There is a palpable sense of excitement accompanying Filipino overseas voters who have cast their ballots in our consular jurisdiction. Voter apathy does not appear to be at play this time around.  I am hopeful that the majority of the 7,331 registered voters under our jurisdiction will heed the Embassy's call to exercise their right to choose their new leaders," Philippine Ambassador Petronila P. Garcia observed.
The Philippine Embassy has consular jurisdiction over Ottawa and areas in Ontario east of Kingston as well as the provinces of Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Islands, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nunavut.
Updates concerning Overseas Voting are announced on  www.philembassy.ca.  Voters who have not received their election packets by mail are advised to call the Philippine Embassy at 613.233.1121 or send an email as soon as possible to

PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION 

Republic of the Philippines v. People's Republic of China

 
 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 

Secretary of Foreign Affairs Albert F. del Rosario 

30 November 2015

 
 
1.    Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, a very good afternoon. Before our Agent, the Honorable Solicitor General, presents our final submissions, it is my honor to respectfully address you one last time in this Great Hall of Justice.
2.    When I first had the privilege of appearing before you in July, it was at the beginning of the hearings on jurisdiction. We did not know then whether or not we would ever reach this point. The Philippines, however, never doubted this Tribunal's jurisdiction.
But there are some who could not believe that the Arbitral Tribunal would have the courage to apply the law to a country like China.
3.    There are those who think the rule of law in international relations does not apply to Great Powers. We reject that view. International law is the great equalizer among States. It allows small countries to stand on an equal footing with more powerful States. Those who think "might makes right" have it backwards. It is exactly the opposite, in that right makes might.
4.    That is why, in January 2013, we confidently put our fate in the hands of this Tribunal and the compulsory dispute resolution mechanisms of UNCLOS. With your wise guidance, we have come a long way.
5.    Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Tribunal, the 29 October Award on Jurisdiction is a remarkable document. It will not only stand the test of time, it will be a model for ages. It is remarkable in many ways, most especially for its moral strength. It is a compelling rebuke to those who doubt that international justice does exist and will prevail.
6.    I say this not just as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs of the Philippines, but also as a global citizen. It is not just the fate of the Philippines that rests in your hands. I note the presence of the distinguished observers from Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam. I thank them for their presence. Other countries too are watching to see what this Tribunal will do.
7.    It is fitting that these hearings are ending as 2015 itself draws to a close. This year marks the 70th anniversary of the United Nations.
That great institution is an expression of the best in us. It is unfortunate that it took one of the saddest episodes in human history to create it. Yet, those of us who lived through that episode also remember the hopes for a new chapter in our common history. We dared to envision a future of enduring peace, shared prosperity and a new era of collaboration.
8.    Two centerpieces of that new order were the sovereign equality of all States, and the commitment to settle disputes peacefully. The sovereign equality of States is enshrined in the first substantive provision of the UN Charter, Article 2(1). The obligation to settle disputes by peaceful means appears subsequently in Article 2(3).
9.    Mechanisms for the compulsory settlement of disputes were also a critical part of this new order.
Article 33(1) specifically mentions arbitration and judicial settlement. And, of course, the Charter also gave birth to the International Court of Justice.
10.    I am proud to say that the Philippines was among the original 51 signatories of the UN Charter. This was true for China as well.
11.    When we started this arbitration, the Philippines was fulfilling one of its most solemn duties, which is to settle international disputes peacefully. The Tribunal knows that our disputes with China in the South China Sea have, for a very long time, complicated our relationship. Most recently, tensions have risen dramatically. Unable to resolve these disputes ourselves, we thus turned to this arbitration to provide all parties a durable, rules-based solution.
12.    China has said that it considers the initiation of this arbitration to be "an unfriendly act." We disagree. In 1982, the UN General Assembly adopted the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes Between States which declared that recourse to the judicial settlement of disputes "should not be considered an unfriendly act between States."
13.    This year is also the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and the People's Republic of China. Since 1975, economic and political ties between our two countries have grown.  We view China as a valued friend. And it is precisely to preserve that friendship that we initiated this arbitration.
 
14.    We believe this arbitration benefits everyone. For China, it will define and clarify its maritime entitlements.
For the Philippines it will clarify what is ours, specifically our fishing rights, rights to resources and rights to enforce our laws within our EEZ. And for the rest of the international community, it will help ensure peace, security, stability and freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea.
 
15.    We also believe that this arbitration will be instructive for other States to consider the dispute settlement mechanisms under UNCLOS as an option for resolving disputes in a peaceful manner.
16.    Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, the Philippines more than anyone is mindful of the fact that your October Award on Jurisdiction was not the end of the story. Several jurisdictional questions were joined to these hearings on the merits.
17.    We trust that last week and again today, our counsel have resolved any lingering jurisdictional concerns you may have. In our view, the Tribunal's jurisdiction could not be clearer with respect to declaring that China's claim to "historic rights" in the areas encompassed by the nine-dash line is inconsistent with UNCLOS. Mr. Reichler showed last Tuesday that the historic rights that China claims are very different from a claim to "historic title" that might be precluded from jurisdiction under Article 298.
18.    On the substance of the matter, Professor Oxman and Mr. Loewenstein showed that the regimes of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone under UNCLOS, and even general international law, plainly exclude China's claim of "historic rights" within the nine-dash line.
Mr. President, I am not a lawyer. But in my mind, when the Convention says that the Philippines' rights in its continental shelf exist ipso facto and ab initio, and do not depend on occupation, that means there is no room for China's claim. And when the Convention speaks of an "exclusive" economic zone, I take exclusive to mean exclusive. That means it is ours, and what is ours is ours, not China's.
19.    On Wednesday morning, Professor Sands showed why we so desperately need your guidance. With an assertiveness that is growing with every passing day, China is preventing us from carrying out even the most basic exploration and exploitation activities in areas where only the Philippines can possibly have rights.
20.    The preamble to the UN Charter states (and I quote)
 
"WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED
...
"to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and
"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom," (end of quote)
 
21.    China is failing on both counts, Mr. President. It is failing to respect the obligations arising from treaties, specifically UNCLOS. It is also interfering with the Philippines' sovereign duty to promote the social progress of our people, and our efforts to achieve a better standard of life for all Filipinos.
22.    China is not just interfering with the progress of the Filipino people. China's unilateral actions, and the atmosphere of intimidation they have created, are also trampling upon the rights and interests of the peoples of Southeast Asia and beyond.
23.    China's massive island building campaign shows its utter disregard for the rights of other States, and for international law. China started this a year after the Philippines initiated the arbitration. It is intent on changing unilaterally the status quo in the region, imposing China's illegal nine-dash line claim by fiat and presenting this Tribunal with a fait accompli.
24.    China's island building not only undermines regional stability, but also the rule of law. It is moreover inflicting massive environmental damage on the most diverse marine environment in the world.
China has intentionally created one of the biggest emerging environmental disasters in the world.
25.    Yet, the stakes are still greater. The Convention's "Constitution for the Oceans" is itself at risk. No State, no matter how powerful, should be allowed to claim an entire sea as its own and to use force or the threat of force in asserting that claim. No State should be permitted to write and re-write the rules in order to justify its expansionist agenda. If that is allowed, the Convention itself would be deemed useless. Power, Mr. President, will have prevailed over reason, and the rule of law would have been rendered meaningless.
26.    We trust that our counsel have made it equally clear that there is no issue of overlapping entitlements beyond 12 M in the South China Sea.
Mr. Reichler and Professor Schofield showed that there is no feature in the Spratly Islands that can sustain human habitation or an economic life of its own. There is therefore no feature that can generate an EEZ or continental shelf. Mr. Reichler called Itu Aba a "Potemkin Island."
27.    Since there are no overlapping entitlements beyond 12 M, the Tribunal is free to rule that China's actions at Mischief Reef, at Second Thomas Shoal and elsewhere violate the Philippines' sovereign rights and jurisdiction.
28.    Last Thursday, Professor Oxman made clear what the practical consequences of deciding that even a single feature in the Spratly Islands generates entitlement beyond 12 M would be. China regards its entitlements in the South China Sea as excluding those of the Philippines and of Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei as well.
It has absolutely no regard for the entitlements of other States. China is also more than willing to use force and the threat of force to enforce its perceived entitlements, even where it has none.
29.    If the Tribunal found that China has a potential entitlement to 200 M on the basis of a speck of broken coral and sand in the middle of the South China Sea, it would effectively hand China the "golden key" that Mr. Martin referred to last Wednesday. The Filipino people would only be able to benefit from the natural resources of our EEZ and continental shelf on China's terms, if at all. In the real world, that would mean not at all.
30.    It would also perpetuate in another form, the same disputes, the same danger and the same instability that China currently exploits without restraint.
And this time it would be much worse: the possibility of a just solution obtained through arbitration will have been exhausted. We will have no other legal avenue of confronting China's unlawful conduct.
31.    Mr. Martin and Professor Oxman showed that the very purpose of Article 121(3) is to prevent such perverse results by denying tiny islands expanded maritime zones. The need for clear and definitive legal constraint is obvious. And it is to you, Mr. President, Members of the Tribunal, to whom we confidently entrust the task of providing the necessary constraint.
32.    Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, if I may say so, there is no greater contribution to international peace and security the Tribunal could make than to decide that none of the features in the Spratly Islands is capable of generating any entitlement beyond 12 M.
The unjustifiable encroachment on the sovereign rights of other States, as well as the global commons, would be avoided. The importance of the sovereignty disputes over these tiny bits of land would be reduced in importance. They would cease to be a casus belli. And the inexcusable harm to the environment resulting from efforts to solidify expansionist maritime claims would be diminished.
33.    Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, we recognize that the Tribunal's mission is in fact judicial. The Tribunal must decide the claims on the basis of the facts and the law, in this case UNCLOS. We submit that on that basis alone, the Tribunal must sustain all of the Philippines' claims, especially in regard to the maritime entitlements of the Parties, and the exclusive sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the Philippines within 200 M of its coasts, except for the 12 M territorial seas around the disputed insular features.
34.    That said, The Tribunal's mandate to achieve justice is not carried out in a vacuum. Judges and arbitrators are not expected to be oblivious to the realities on the ground. UNCLOS is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The object and purpose of the Charter, as well as those of the Convention, are far from irrelevant. These purposes include the maintenance and strengthening of international peace and security. Nothing would contribute more to these objectives than the Tribunal's finding that China's rights and obligations are neither more nor less than those established by UNCLOS. And that the entitlements of the tiny insular features it claims are limited to 12 M.
35.    Finding otherwise would gravely undermine these same objectives. It would leave the Philippines, and its ASEAN neighbors, in worse straits than when we embarked on this arbitral voyage.
It would convert the nine-dash line, or its equivalent in the form of exaggerated maritime zones for tiny, uninhabitable features, into a Berlin Wall of the Sea. A giant fence, owned by, and excluding everyone but, China itself.
36.    We are confident that you will interpret and apply the law in a way that produces a truly just solution. That is the best way-indeed, the only way-to craft a legal solution that truly promotes peace, security and good neighborliness in the South China Sea.
37.    Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, all that remains for me to do is to say thank you. First, I wish to thank our counsel. The Philippines could not have entrusted this case, our fate, to more skilled, principled and determined Professionals.
I know they share the Philippines' firm conviction about the need to uphold the international rule of law as the bedrock of peace, order and stability in our world.
38.    Second, I wish to thank the most able personnel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration who have provided all of us with the diligent assistance that has made these proceedings run so smoothly. We know none of this would have been possible without them.
 
39.    And finally, Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, on behalf of our President, Benigno S. Aquino III, on behalf of myself and on behalf of all the Filipino people, I wish to humbly thank each of you for the care, dedication, wisdom and courage with which you have conducted these proceedings.
We confidently entrust our fate, the fate of the region and, indeed, the fate of the Convention to you. We know that in your capable hands, the rule of law will not be reduced to the quaint aspiration of a time now past, but rather will be accorded the primacy that the founders of the United Nations and the drafters of UNCLOS envisioned.
 
40.    Mr. President, Distinguished Members of the Tribunal, we proffer to you our deepest gratitude. May I now ask that you kindly invite the Honorable Solicitor General to the lectern to present the final Submissions of the Philippines. Thank you once again.

  			<a title="08 July 2015 -A high-level Philippine team for the UNCLOS arbitration case being heard by an arbitral tribunal in The Hague has begun presenting the arguments for the Philippine position, with emphasis on the tribunal's jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.
On the first day of the oral arguments on 7 July 2015, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Albert del Rosario explained the reasons for the Philippines' decision to seek arbitration in its maritime dispute with China.
"China has pursued its activities in these disputed maritime areas with overwhelming force. The Philippines can only counter by invoking international law. That is why it is of fundamental importance to the Philippines, and we would submit, for the rule of law in general, for the Tribunal to decide where and to what limit China has maritime entitlements in the South China Sea; where and to what limit the Philippines has maritime entitlements; where and to what extent the Parties' respective entitlements overlap and where they do not. None of this requires or even invites the Tribunal to make any determinations on questions of land sovereignty, or delimitation of maritime boundaries," Secretary del Rosario stated.  He made an impassioned plea for the tribunal to recognize its jurisdiction over a case laden with ramifications for the application of the rule of law in maritime disputes not only in the South China Sea but elsewhere in the world.
The full text of Secretary del Rosario's speech is attached.
On the second day of the oral arguments, the Philippines' lawyers will further explain how the Philippine case did not fall under the specific UNCLOS exemptions that preclude the tribunal from hearing the case. They also will present arguments manifesting the strength of the Philippines' environmental and fishing claims against China.
The Philippine legal team is expected to summarize the Philippines' case and reply to questions to be raised by the tribunal before the oral arguments conclude on July 13. END

WHY THE PHILIPPINES BROUGHT THIS CASE TO ARBITRATION AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE REGION AND THE WORLD Republic of the Philippines v. People's Republic of China
STATEMENT BEFORE THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION H.E. Albert F. del Rosario, Secretary of Foreign Affairs7 July 2015
1.	Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, it is a great honor to respectfully appear before you on behalf of my country, the Republic of the Philippines. It is indeed a special privilege to do so in a case that has such importance to all Filipinos and -- if I may add -- to the rule of law in international relations.
2.	Mr. President, the Philippines has long placed its faith in the rules and institutions that the international community has created to regulate relations among States. We are proud to have been a founding member of the United Nations, and an active participant in that indispensable institution.
3.	Its organs, coupled with the power of international law, serve as the great equalizer among States, allowing countries, such as my own, to stand on an equal footing with wealthier, more powerful States.
4.	Nowhere is this more true, Mr. President, than with respect to the progressive development of the law of the sea, which culminated in the adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention in 1982.  That instrument, which has rightly been called a "Constitution for the Oceans," counts among its most important achievements the establishment of clear rules regarding the peaceful use of the seas, freedom of navigation, protection of the maritime environment and, perhaps most importantly, clearly defined limits on the maritime areas in which States are entitled to exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction.
5.	These are all matters of central significance to the Philippines.  Indeed, given our lengthy coastline, our status as an archipelagic state, and our seafaring tradition, the rules codified in the law of the sea have always had particular importance for the Philippines. The Philippines is justifiably proud of the fact that it signed the Convention on the day it was opened for signature, on 10 December 1982, and was one of the first States to submit its instrument of ratification, which it did on 8 May 1984.
6.	The Philippines has respected and implemented its rights and obligations under the Convention in good faith. This can be seen in the amendment of our national legislation to bring the Philippines' maritime claims into compliance with the Convention, by converting our prior straight baselines into archipelagic baselines in conformity with Articles 46 and 47, and by providing that the maritime zones of the Kalayaan Island Group and Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea would be consistent with Article 121.
7.	The Philippines took these important steps, Mr. President, because we understand, and accept, that compliance with the rules of the Convention is required of all States Parties.
8.	I mentioned a moment ago the equalizing power of international law.  Perhaps no provisions of the Convention are as vital to achieving this critical objective than Part XV.  It is these dispute resolution provisions that allow the weak to challenge the powerful on an equal footing, confident in the conviction that principles trump power; that law triumphs over force; and that right prevails over might.
9.	Mr. President, allow me to respectfully make it clear: in submitting this case, the Philippines is NOT asking the Tribunal to rule on the territorial sovereignty aspect of its disputes with China.
10.	We are here because we wish to clarify our maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, a question over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction. This is a matter that is most important not only to the Philippines, but also to all coastal States that border the South China Sea, and even to all the States Parties to UNCLOS. It is a dispute that goes to the very heart of UNCLOS itself. Our very able counsel will have much more to say about this legal dispute over the interpretation of the Convention during the course of these oral hearings. But in my humble layman's view, the central legal dispute in this case can be expressed as follows:
11.	For the Philippines, the maritime entitlements of coastal States - to a territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, and the rights and obligations of the States Parties within these respective zones - are established, defined and limited by the express terms of the Convention. Those express terms do not allow for - in fact they preclude - claims to broader entitlements, or sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, over maritime areas beyond the limits of the EEZ or continental shelf. In particular, the Convention does not recognize, or permit the exercise of, so called "historic rights" in areas beyond the limits of the maritime zones that are recognized or established by UNCLOS.
12.	Sadly, China disputes this, Mr. President, in both word and deed. It claims that it is entitled to exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction, including the exclusive right to the resources of the sea and seabed, far beyond the limits established by the Convention, based on so-called "historic rights" to these areas. Whether these alleged "historic rights" extend to the limits generally established by China's so-called "nine dash line", as appears to be China's claim, or whether they encompass a greater or a narrower portion of the South China Sea, the indisputable fact, and the central element of the legal dispute between the Parties, is that China has asserted a claim of "historic rights" to vast areas of the sea and seabed that lie far beyond the limits of its EEZ and continental shelf entitlements under the Convention.
13.	In fact, China has done much more, Mr. President, than to simply claim these alleged "historic rights." It has acted forcefully to assert them, by exploiting the living and non-living resources in the areas beyond the UNCLOS limits while forcibly preventing other coastal States, including the Philippines, from exploiting the resources in the same areas - even though the areas lie well within 200 M of the Philippines' coast and, in many cases, hundreds of miles beyond any EEZ or continental shelf that China could plausibly claim under the Convention.
14.	The legal dispute between the Philippines and China over China's claim to and exercise of alleged "historic rights" is a matter falling under the Convention, and particularly Part XV, regardless of whether China is claiming that "historic rights" are recognized under the Convention, or allowable under the Convention because they are not precluded by it. China has made both arguments in its public statements. But it makes no difference for purposes of the characterization of this dispute as one calling for the interpretation or application of the Convention. The question raised by the conflicting positions of the Philippines and China boils down to this: Are maritime entitlements to be governed strictly by UNCLOS, thus precluding claims of maritime entitlements based on "historic rights"? Or does the UNCLOS allow a State to claim entitlements based on "historic" or other rights even beyond those provided for in the Convention itself?
15.	As our counsel will explain, Mr. President, any recognition of such "historic rights" conflicts with the very character of UNCLOS and its express provisions concerning the maritime entitlements of coastal States. This calls indisputably for the proper interpretation of the fundamental nature of the Convention.
16.	China's assertion and exercise of its alleged rights in areas beyond its entitlements under UNCLOS have created significant uncertainty and instability in our relations with China and in the broader region. In this respect, I note the presence here today of representatives of Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan to observe these critical proceedings.
17.	Mr. President, China has claimed "historic rights" in areas that are beyond 200 M from its mainland coasts, or any land feature over which it claims sovereignty, and within 200 M of the coasts of the Philippines' main islands, and exploited the resources in these areas while preventing the Philippines from doing so. It has therefore, in the Philippines' view, breached the Convention by violating Philippine sovereign rights and jurisdiction. China has pursued its activities in these disputed maritime areas with overwhelming force. The Philippines can only counter by invoking international law. That is why it is of fundamental importance to the Philippines, and we would submit, for the rule of law in general, for the Tribunal to decide where and to what limit China has maritime entitlements in the South China Sea; where and to what limit the Philippines has maritime entitlements; where and to what extent the Parties' respective entitlements overlap and where they do not. None of this requires or even invites the Tribunal to make any determinations on questions of land sovereignty, or delimitation of maritime boundaries.
18.	The Philippines understands that the jurisdiction of this tribunal convened under UNCLOS is limited to questions that concern the law of the sea. With this in mind, we have taken great care to place before you only claims that arise directly under the Convention.  As counsel for the Philippines will discuss at length in the coming days, we have, in essence, presented five (5) principal claims.  They are:
a.	First, that China is not entitled to exercise what it refers to as "historic rights" over the waters, seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of its entitlements under the Convention;b.	Second, that the so-called nine dash line has no basis whatsoever under international law insofar as it purports to define the limits of China's claim to "historic rights";c.	Third, that the various maritime features relied upon by China as a basis upon which to assert its claims in the South China Sea are not islands that generate entitlement to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.  Rather, some are "rocks" within the meaning of Article 121, paragraph 3; others are low-tide elevations; and still others are permanently submerged. As a result, none are capable of generating entitlements beyond 12M, and some generate no entitlements at all.  China's recent massive reclamation activities cannot lawfully change the original nature and character of these features;d.	Fourth, that China has breached the Convention by interfering with the Philippines' exercise of its sovereign rights and jurisdiction; and e.	Fifth, that China has irreversibly damaged the regional marine environment, in breach of UNCLOS, by its destruction of coral reefs in the South China Sea, including areas within the Philippines' EEZ, by its destructive and hazardous fishing practices, and by its harvesting of endangered species.
19.	Mr. President, the Philippines is committed to resolving its disputes with China peacefully and in accordance with international law.  For over two decades, we diligently pursued that objective bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally.  I will not here take this Tribunal through the Philippines' painstaking and exhaustive diplomatic efforts, which are set out in detail in our written pleadings.  I will, however, mention a few representative examples, if I may.
20.	As far back as August 1995, after China seized and built structures on Mischief Reef -- a low-tide elevation located 126 nautical miles from the Philippine island of Palawan and more than 600 nautical miles from the closest point on China's Hainan Island -- the Philippines sought to address China's violation of its maritime rights diplomatically. During those exchanges, the Philippines and China agreed that the dispute should be resolved in accordance with UNCLOS.  As the then Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tang Jiaxuan, stated two years later during bilateral negotiations, China and the Philippines should "approach the disputes on the basis of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, particularly its provisions on the maritime regimes like the exclusive economic zone."
21.	The mutual acceptance that the Philippines' disputes with China must be resolved in accordance with UNCLOS was also reflected in a Joint Communiqué issued in July 1998 upon completion of bilateral discussions between my predecessor, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, and China's Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.  The Communiqué recorded that, and I quote, "The two sides exchanged views on the question of the South China Sea and reaffirmed their commitment that the relevant disputes shall be settled peacefully in accordance with the established principles of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea." (End of quote)
22.	Regrettably, neither the bilateral exchanges I have mentioned, nor any of the great many subsequent exchanges, proved capable of resolving the impasse caused by China's intransigent insistence that China alone possesses maritime rights in virtually the entirety of the South China Sea, and that the Philippines must recognize and accept China's sovereignty before meaningful discussion of other issues could take place.
23.	The Philippines has also been persistent in seeking a diplomatic solution under the auspices of ASEAN.  This has proven no more successful than our bilateral efforts.  In fact, China has insisted that ASEAN cannot be used to resolve any territorial or maritime disputes concerning the South China Sea, and that such issues can only be dealt with in bilateral negotiations.  ASEAN and China have yet to conclude a binding code of conduct in the South China Sea.  The most that has been achieved was the issuance, in 2002, of a "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea."  Although that document recorded the parties' commitment to work toward the "eventual" establishment of a code of conduct in the South China Sea, China's intransigence in the 13 years of subsequent multilateral negotiations has made that goal nearly unattainable.
24.	Nonetheless, Mr. President, the 2002 DOC is significant in at least one important respect: the ASEAN Member States and China undertook therein to "resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned, in accordance with universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."  In so doing, the Declaration encouraged those States, should they prove unable to resolve their disputes through consultations or negotiations, to do so in accordance with the Convention, which includes, of course, the dispute resolution procedures under Part XV.
25.	Mr. President, over the years, China's positions and behavior have become progressively more aggressive and disconcerting. Outside observers have referred to this as China's "salami-slicing" strategy:  that is, taking little steps over time, none of which individually is enough to provoke a crisis. Chinese military officials themselves have referred to this as its "cabbage" strategy: peeling one layer off at a time. When these small steps are taken together, however, they reflect China's efforts to slowly consolidate de facto control throughout the South China Sea.
26.	Two more recent incremental steps caused the Philippines to conclude that it had no alternative other than to invoke compulsory procedures entailing a binding decision.  The first was China's transmittal of its nine-dash line claim to the United Nations in 2009, after which, it prevented the Philippines from carrying out long-standing oil and gas development projects in areas that are well inside the Philippines' 200 M EEZ and continental shelf.
27.	Secondly, in 2012, China forcibly expelled Philippine fishermen from the maritime areas around Scarborough Shoal where the Filipino fishermen have for generations been fishing without so much as a protest from China.
28.	These and other acts by China caused the Philippines to conclude that continued diplomatic efforts, whether bilateral or multilateral, would be futile, and that the only way to resolve our maritime disputes was to commence the present arbitration.
29.	Subsequent events, including China's acceleration of massive land reclamation activities, which it has undertaken -- and continues to undertake -- in blatant disregard of the Philippines rights' in its EEZ and continental shelf, and at tremendous cost to the marine environment in violation of UNCLOS -- only serve to reconfirm the need for judicial intervention.
30.	Mr. President, I would like to conclude by conveying my country's deepest appreciation for the considerable time and attention you have devoted to these proceedings.  The case before you is of the utmost importance to the Philippines, to the region, and to the world.  In our view, it is also of utmost significance to the integrity of the Convention, and to the very fabric of the "legal order for the seas and oceans" that the international community so painstakingly crafted over many years.
31.	If China can defy the limits placed by the Convention on its maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, and disregard the entitlements of the Philippines under the Convention, then what value is there in the Convention for small States Parties as regards their bigger, more powerful and better armed neighbors? Can the Philippines not invoke Part XV to challenge China's activities as violations of its obligations and the Philippines' rights, considering that the Philippines' claims call for a mere interpretation and application of the Convention and do not fall within any of the jurisdictional exclusions of Articles 297 or 298?
32.	Mr. President, if the Philippines cannot invoke Part XV, then what remains of the obligation regarding judicial settlement of disputes that was such a key element of the comprehensive package that made the Convention acceptable to all State Parties?
33.	We understand, Mr. President, that in the exercise of its collective wisdom and judgment, this body has decided to bifurcate the proceedings and to limit these current hearings to the issue of jurisdiction. In this respect, we shall explain in full how our case falls squarely within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, to the end that justice and fair play may prevail and the Tribunal would recognize its jurisdiction over the case and allow the Philippines to present the actual merits of our position.
34.	In the Philippines' view, it is not just the Philippines' claims against China that rest in your capable hands. Mr. President, it is the spirit of UNCLOS itself. That is why, we submit, these proceedings have attracted so much interest and attention. We call on the Tribunal to kindly uphold the Convention and enable the rule of law to prevail.
35.	I humbly thank you, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the Tribunal. May I now ask that Philippines' counsel, Mr. Paul Reichler, be called to the podium.

  			<a title="Ottawa - Exotic and ecological, Philippine heirloom rice makes its debut in the Canadian market, as various varieties of the Filipino food staple are now available for online purchase across Canada in time for the holiday season. Up until this time, these treasured aromatic varieties were rarely sold in the commercial market.
Level Ground Trading, based in Victoria, British Columbia, has announced the availability of Philippine heirloom rice varieties coming from the japonica family, such as the Aromatic (ulikan), the Long Grain (mini-angan) red rice, and the Glutinous (ominio) sticky violet rice. Heretofore available only in the hinterlands of Luzon island, these varieties can now be delivered straight to Canadian households. Level Ground is solely responsible for the only shipment of rice exports from the Philippines this year.
The rice varieties are of significant cultural importance in the Cordillera region. The ulikan/mini-angan for one is traditionally given as a wedding gift to newlyweds, to bring prosperity and food security. It is steeped in folklore and legend among ethnic tribes in the Philippines as a gift from ancestral leaders.
Meanwhile, outside the Philippines, the ominio variety or violet rice itself can be cultivated only in Indonesia and Madagscar and is the preferred grain for preparing rice desserts and for making rice wine. The origin of the ominiio plays a significant role in the mythology of certain tribes in the Mountain Province. It is also known as balatinao, and kotinao, and its sticky properties is referred to as diket, chekat, daya'ot/dayakkot, jekot or chaycot.
The rice varieties are being offered in either 700 gram boxes I cases of six or 5 kilogram boxes. The rice is highly nutritious rice (one variety has up to 4g of protein/serving). They are 100% non-GMO varieties and are sun-dried, threshed and de-hulled in the Philippines. Farmers have made a commitment to only use organic fertilizers and disavow the use of any chemical. They can be readily ordered from http://www.levelground.com/store/shop/. Level Ground also markets coconut oil products coming from the Philippines as well.
Philippine Ambassador Petronila Garcia notes that "heirloom rice is tremendously important to the biodiversity of the place it is associated with." She expressed optimism that with heirloom, healthy and organic products gaining traction in the Canadian market, benefits will redound to all stakeholders concerned. It will also ensure the long term viability of rare Philippine varieties of rice.
Stacey Toews, Co-Founder and Communications Catalyst of Level Ground stands solidly behind the rice varieties saying that "at last - the beautiful heirloom rice from the Philippines is available." Level Ground Trading underwent a prolonged period of working with farmers and other stakeholders, and overcame various logistical challenges in bringing the rice varieties to the market. Level Ground notes "rice is a crop that has been greatly affected by the movement toward monoculture and the heavy emphasis on planting hybrid varieties. In the Philippines there still remains an incredible variety of heirloom rice." Philippine rice-producing partners of Level Ground are spread across 18 communities, stretching across 3 provinces of the Cordillera Region.
The availability of the rice varieties is testament to the collaborative work among Level Ground, the farmers and stakeholders and non-government organizations, as well that with the International Rice research Institute based in the Philippines, and the Philippine Department of Agriculture that also ensures and sustains the global genetic diversity of rice.
Traditional Philippine holiday staples such as the arroz caldo, biko, bibingka, kutsinta, palitao and puto bungbong will dazzle with the use of Philippine aromatic, long grain and glutinous rice now available in Canada, making the traditional Christmas Noche Buena feast and the New Year table setting a truly exceptional for this and the coming years. END

Moreover, the Philippines and Canada recently concluded an expanded air services agreement that holds the promise for greater two-way trade, investment and tourism flows. The Ambassador expressed optimism that the forum would enable everyone "to work on synergies between our two economies in how we do business with one another and the rest of the world."
For her part, Corrie MacDougall of the Ontario International Trade Branch of the Province of Ontario looked forward to the outcome of the business mission to the Philippines they are organizing in July 2015.
Marti Falcone from Export Development Canada outlined the products and services offered to Philippine and Canadian enterprises in furthering trade and investment transactions.

Ottawa - Ottawa's business, trade and diplomatic community came together on 30 October 2014 at the elite Rideau Club in Ottawa for the McDonald-Laurier Institute breakfast forum to discuss new prospects for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The event was an opportunity to hear from top experts on some of Canada's most important trade opportunities.
With TPP negotiations continuing in Australia, New Zealand High Commissioner Simon Tucker told a packed hall at the Rideau Club that he could sense that "momentum has tipped upward". He continued to say that the "TPP will grow over time, and Canada's trade opportunities will grow with it".
The group then discussed what will come after negotiations conclude with the original 12 member countries, including prospects for South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.
Trade expert and Macdonald-Laurier Institute Senior Fellow Laura Dawson reported on some of the findings of her new paper, Finding the Hidden Dragon, on increasing opportunities for trade with Taiwan, and the prospects for Taiwan joining TPP negotiations in the future. She told the audience, "Taiwan is all the things you want in a trade relationship with China, and none of the things you don't want".
Carleton business professor Ian Lee declared that "Europe is Canada's past, America is Canada's present, Asia is Canada's future".
As a country interested in joining the TPP, Philippine Minister and Consul General Eric Tamayo indicated that the Philippines has made the decision to join the TPP and a roadmap has been defined towards participation, noting inherent challenges "to the quality of trade that is being sought, or the standards demanded, under the TPP." Mr. Tamayo drew attention to efforts by the government in "implementing changes where it can, in easing trade and investment flows."
The event was moderated by MLI Managing Director Brian Lee Crowley and introductory remarks were made by Dean Allison, Member of Parliament and Chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, and Bruce Linghu, Special Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada. The forum was organized with the co-operation with Dawson Strategic and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Ottawa. END

  			<a title="The Philippines is now a priority market for Canada.
Under the Global Markets Action Plan (GMAP) of Canada, the Philippines is now designated as a priority emerging market -- offering value and opportunity for a broad range of Canadian interests.
The designation is an affirmation of the positive developments concerning the Philippine economy which Canada now deems to demonstrate a high potential for economic growth, where Canadian capabilities have a best potential for success, and where government support, through economic diplomacy, can have the greatest impact.
The Philippinesnow becomes a priority country for facilitating foreign direct investment, and partnerships in technology and talent by the government of Canada in working with various Canadian enterprises.
Canada has identified priority areas for further commercial engagement.These are agriculture and agri-food, defense and security, education, Information and communications technologies, infrastructure, mining and sustainable technologies.
The Philippines joins 21 other economies across the globe as a priority emerging market for Canada. It now also joins other ASEAN partners such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam into the GMAP Emerging Market Priority Category.
The development bodes well for increased Philippines-Canada economic linkages and exchanges and provides a crucial boost in confidence for Canadian business in doing business with and in the Philippines. The designation comes after Canada named the Philippine as a country of focus for development aid in June this year.
As of 2013, total trade between the Philippines and Canada increased by 13.25% to C$1.7 Billion. The Philippines enjoys a trade surplus with Canada with Philippine exports increasing to C$1.14 Billion for the past year. Philippine imports from Canada stood at C$603.4 Million (as adjusted).
Further facilitating two-way trade is the recent expanded air services agreement between the two countries, increasing the frequency of flights and facilitating code sharing among air carriers. In 2013, the Philippines received 131,381 visitors from Canada making Canada the 8th largest source of tourists for the country. In January 2014, the first edition of the Winter Escapade - It's More Fun In The Philippines, helped spur economic activity in typhoon-devastated areas of Panay Island. END

  			<a title=" SASKATOON - A big dig unparalleled, 1.2 kilometers down and 10 kilometers out - throughout an alternating grid of perpendicular and parallel tunnels no more than 4 meters high by 8 meters wide - and boring through mineral deposits spanning approximately the total land territory of the Philippines, thus Team Philippines in Canada ventured into 300 million years of planetary tectonic shifts underneath Saskatchewan to rediscover first hand -- and literally unearth, the secret of the modern global sustainable agriculture and food industry, and one of its critical supply chain links - potash mining.
On the occasion of the Economic Diplomacy and Consular Mission of Team Philippines in Canada from 24 to 28 March 2013, Philippine Ambassador Leslie B. Gatan, accompanied by Philippine Consul General in Toronto Junever Mahilum-West, Minister for Economic Affairs Eric Tamayo and Labor Office Francisco Luna, probed the inner workings of a veritable potashopolis of sloping reserves, rolling winnepegosis reefs and other related seismic formations, and its connections with ensuring global food supply and agriculture and food productivity.
The tunnels are slowly closing in on themselves, the weight of millions of years and tons of potash bearing down on the caverns gouged out by massive boring machines - supported merely by 8 and 10 foot rods. The walls, floors and ceilings, when lit by the passing of specially-retrofitted vehicles, reveal the red and pink hues of the otherwise white crystalline potash meshed with traces of iron oxide.
Potash -- or potassium chloride, is one of three key nutrients essential for plant growth, the other two being nitrogen and phosphate. According to industry sources, potash is one of Canada's largest resources and a major export commodity -- and the country is experiencing a big bonanza of late as agriculture production across the globe continues to ramp up. With ten mines, Saskatchewan produces potash from reserves large enough to supply the world fertilizer demand for several hundred more years. Canada is the largest supplier of potash in the world.
The Philippines imports about 120,000 metric tons of potash from Canada, complementing the domestic phosphate industry and providing essential nutrients to support agricultural croplands producing among others sugar, rice, bananas, and corn. End

  			<a title="PHILIPPINES IS DESTINATION OF THE YEAR 2014
The Philippines is awarded the Destination of the Year at the 25th Annual TTG Travel Awards 2014, just a few months before the Department of Tourism (DOT) sets on to raise the country's international profile with its Visit the Philippines Year 2015 campaign.
Organized annually by the giant TTG Asia Media's Travel Trade Publishing group, the TTG Travel Awards has been recognizing the best of Asia-Pacific's travel trade since 1989. The prestigious travel industry event marks an important time for the industry to recognize the exemplary organizations that raise the bar of excellence. The exclusive event honors stellar organizations and individuals in 4 categories: Travel Supplier, Travel Agency, Outstanding Achievement, and Travel Hall of Fame.
DOT Travel Award 1.10.03.2014
Secretary of Tourism Ramon R. Jimenez Jr accepted the award before Asia's tourism professionals at the Awarding Ceremony and Gala Dinner held on 2 October 2014 at the Centara Grand and Bangkok Convention Center in Thailand. The Philippines was chosen as the region's most outstanding destination in 2014 for distinguishing itself with its proactive steps and initiatives towards the development and promotion of the travel industry. The Destination of the Year falls under the Outstanding Achievement Awards. Other categories include Travel Personality of the Year, Best Travel Entrepreneur, Best Marketing and Relationship Effort, and Best Trade Supporter. The winners are determined by TTG's editorial team.
"We would like to thank TTG for the invaluable support extended to our organization in our marketing and information dissemination efforts. As a trusted travel trade publication, it has been a formidable partner throughout these years in bringing the Philippines closer to our markets," DOT Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez Jr. said.
The TTG Travel Awards is now reputed as the most coveted and influential awards to be garnered in the region's travel industry. The signature trophy, a statuette of Hermes (the god of travel and protector of travellers in ancient Greek mythology), is cast in solid pewter and plated in 24K gold. Weighing two kilograms, the Hermes trophy has since then been the icon of the annual awards.DOT travel award 2.10.03.2014
"This award belongs to all Filipinos. It is the Filipino people that have ensured the acceptance of It's More Fun in the Philippines as a true and accurate description of the participative and active role every Filipino plays in ensuring a successful and enjoyable visit to the Philippines. Again, the determination of the Filipino people, coupled with the support of our President, Benigno S. Aquino III, is our inspiration to build a brighter tourism future for the Philippines-an industry that is more profitable and more inclusive," Secretary Jimenez concluded.
The DOT is gearing up its efforts to promote Visit the Philippines Year (VPY) 2015 - an invitation for all to experience the enduring promise of more fun in the Philippines. Encouraging nationwide participation, DOT aims to stamp passports of 10 million visitors to the Philippines as the country hosts major events such as the Papal Visit in January and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meetings and Leaders' Summit.

  			<a title="10 March 2012 - The Philippine Embassy in Ottawa reported to the Department that Ambassador Leslie B. Gatan led Philippine participation in the 18th Ottawa Travel and Vacation show held on 10-11 March 2012 at the Ottawa Convention Centre.

Ambassador Gatan joined the Honorable Diana Ablonczy, Minister of State of Foreign Affairs, and His Worship, Mayor Jim Watson, at the ceremonies opening the show. In his welcome remarks, Mayor Watson hailed the travel show for enabling visitors to travel around the world in one hour.  He also cited the saleability of culinary, heritage and cultural trips to Canada's ageing population.  Minister Ablonczy opened the show which she regarded as a "tremendous way of building bridges and friendships around the world."  Describing Canadians as adventuresome, she noted that 56 million trips, out of a population of 33 million, are made by Canadians each year.  She encouraged Canadian travellers to observe the three R's (Read, Register and Reach Us) when taking trips abroad.
The Ambassador discussed Philippine destinations with exhibitors and other visitors to the Philippine booth that included Minister Ablonczy herself.

Since participating in travel shows in Canada several years ago, more and more tour operators have been selling Philippine packages.  These include Tours Hai International, Jade Tours, Handa Travel, and Royal Scenic, among others.  At the show, there was palpable interest in selling more Philippine destinations as demonstrated by Uniktour, Travel Professionals International and Family Travel Scoop.

The forthcoming 7th Ambassadors, Consuls General and Tourism Directors (ACGTD) Tour was also earnestly marketed by the Philippine Embassy with promising results.  The Embassy launching of the ACGTD Tour will take place in Ottawa and Montreal on 15 and 16 March 2012, respectively.
Besides tourism, the Philippine Embassy took the occasion to promote Philippine products and food.  Filipino shell craft, baskets and the turon were the top drawers inviting queries and compliments from visitors.
Philippine participation in the travel show was organized by the Philippine Department of Tourism office in New York represented by Ms. Mitchelle T. Dy, Deputy Director for Marketing.
Visited by some 16,000 travel-ready Canadians, the 18th Ottawa Travel and Visitors Show boasted over 190 travel and vacation exhibits from over 50 countries.  Ottawa is home to 1.2 million well-educated, affluent Canadians with the second highest per capita income of all major Canadian cities.
"Filipinos in Canada are well-placed to persuade their Canadian friends to take an interest in a Philippine vacation, as Canadian visitors to the Philippine booth proved.  Together with the Filipino community, the Embassy hopes to generate more buzz for Philippine destinations in line with its economic diplomacy program," Ambassador Gatan stated. END

  			<a title="Panglao Island in Bohol is one of the best secret beaches in the world, according to an influential American magazine.
The island, a well-established tourist destination in the Philippines, is one of the 17 areas featured in Travel + Leisure's "Best Secret Beaches on Earth" feature, which is part of the magazine's March 2012 issue.
"An hour-long flight from Manila to Bohol island followed by a 25-minute drive across a 19th-century causeway brings you to this secluded Central Visayas isle," author David Keeps wrote in the Travel + Leisure article.
Keeps particularly cited the Ananyana Beach Resort and Spa, which "occupies a prime spot on a mile-long stretch of sand."
"The 12 luxe thatched-roof huts have bamboo-framed king-size beds; the al fresco restaurant turns out Filipino-Mediterranean dishes such as penne with pork adobo; and the lounge is outfitted with regionally made rattan and abaca furniture," he wrote.
"Hop a resort boat for dolphin watching, diving amid the drop-offs of Balicasag island, or, for the ultimate castaway fantasy, a sunset dinner on deserted Puntod Island," he added.
The article also recommended other sites in Bohol such as the Bohol Bee Farm, which serves dishes such as homemade ube (purple yam) ice cream, and the Chocolate Hills, which was described as "a surreal wonder of 1,776 dome-shaped hills formed from limestone covered in grass."
Meanwhile, here are the other beaches that made it to the list of Travel + Leisure's best secret beaches:

Todos Santos, Baja California Sur, Mexico
Puako, Big Islang, Hawaii

In his remarks, Ambassador Gatan put the spotlight on the Philippines against the backdrop of a rising Asia.  Making use of the Department of Tourism's new "It's More Fun in the Philippines" campaign, he touted the famed Filipino hospitality and ebullience as unique ingredients of an unforgettable Philippine holiday.

The Philippines was among the seven Asian countries featured in the Cultural Night which included China, India, Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Malaysia.  Filipino performers from the Living Foundation Christian Fellowship in Ottawa presented the Pandanggo sa Ilaw and the Tinikling upon the invitation of the Philippine Embassy.

  			<a title="More than 30,000 former Filipinos reacquired their Philippine citizenship under the so-called dual citizenship law in 2012, the Bureau of Immigration (BI) yesterday said.Immigration Commissioner Ricardo David Jr. disclosed the bureau in 2012 processed a total of 30,362 applications for dual citizenship under Republic Act 9225 or the Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003.
Under Republic Act 9225, also known as the citizenship retention and reacquisition act of 2003, natural-born Filipinos who became naturalized citizens of other countries are deemed not to have lost their citizenship by taking the required oath of allegiance to the Philippine republic.
David said of the total number of dual citizens processed last year, 5,564 filed their petitions at the BI main office in Manila while the rest applied at the various Philippine consulates abroad.
There were more applicants last year compared to 2011 when only 19,328 petitions were processed, of which 15,657 originated from the Philippine consulates.David urged former Filipinos who wished to enjoy again their rights and privileges as Philippine citizens to avail themselves of the benefits of the  law.BI legal officer Marc Anthony Antonio, who heads the BI task force on RA 9225, stressed that all natural-born Filipinos who lost their Philippine citizenship can avail themselves of the benefits of the law.
Antonio also clarified that the number of those who actually applied at Philippine consulates was much higher as BI statistics only refer to those who applied for their identification certificates at the bureau.
He estimated that since RA 9225 was implemented in 2004, no fewer than 150,000 former Filipinos worldwide may have already availed themselves of the law.Antonio said Americans topped the list of the applicants, followed by Britons and Canadians, most of whom filed their petitions at the Philippine consulates in Washington DC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Honolulu, Ottawa, Vancouver, Toronto and London.
Antonio added that an applicant pays only a fee of P3,000 and the petition is immediately processed if all documentary requirements submitted are complete.  Conrado Ching

  			<a title="08 July 2015 - The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advises the public to be alert to the modus operandi of drug syndicates, as well as the profile of recruiters working for them and their victims, as described below. The information on the modus operandi of drug syndicates is based on the report from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).
Modus Operandi of Drug Syndicates in Recruiting Drug Couriers
Drug syndicate recruiters meet potential victims through casual acquaintances or through the Internet in order to befriend, enter into a relationship and/or marry the victim. The potential drug courier is lured or attracted by the offer of payment of US$3,000 up to US$15,000 for every successful delivery or transaction. They are provided with plane tickets and hotel accommodations. African Drug Syndicate (ADS) members, in particular, are engaged in the importation of illegal drugs in low amounts at a high frequency.
Profile of Drug Couriers
Drug couriers that have been caught are mostly male. Some are displaced overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who are looking for a job abroad. Some have a poor educational background. However, some drug couriers are also, in fact, well-educated. In their case, they were lured by drug syndicates who offered them "easy money" and the opportunity to travel to different countries. Drug syndicate recruiters also take advantage of a potential victim's desire to enter into a relationship or marriage.
Why are drug syndicates recruiting Filipinos in particular?
Drug syndicates target Filipinos specifically for their proficiency in the English language, their ability to speak other languages, and their skill with computers and the Internet. Filipinos are deemed by drug syndicates to have an "unassuming behavior" which attracts less attention from police or airport authorities. Filipinos also, in general, have a positive disposition which drug syndicate recruiters exploit.
A Reminder to the Public:
Observe the Law When Traveling, Be Extra Careful and Alert
We appeal to all Filipinos not to be victimized by international drug syndicates and to avoid falling for the modus operandi employed by drug trafficking syndicates.
We call for personal vigilance and responsibility on the part of Filipinos who travel abroad. We remind our kababayans that the laws imposed by host countries govern cases of drug trafficking.
We hope that this information will help our kababayans to be more equipped in preventing themselves from becoming victims of drug syndicates. END
