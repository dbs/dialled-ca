19 February 2016 - For the third year running, visitors from across Canada and the U.S. flocked to the Philippines for the annual Winter Escapade - It's More Fun in the Philippines group tour spearheaded by the Philippine Embassy in Ottawa and the Philippine Consulates General in Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Halifax, with the support of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Tourism Promotions Board as well as the Department of Tourism's regional offices and representatives in New York and San Francisco.

Over 300 snowbirds from the Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia escaped wintry conditions to bask in warm climes of eastern and western Philippines from 3 to 12 February 2016.
Selected destinations in the Bicol region, Puerto Princesa and Metro-Manila for this year's tour met high expectations of a travel experience unique to the Winter Escapade brand.  Day One gathered all participants in a pre-tour briefing over breakfast hosted by Western Union followed by a solemn wreath laying ceremony at the Rizal Park.  Philippine Ambassador to Canada, Her Excellency Petronila P. Garcia, and Liz Villasenor, Head of the Manila City Tourism Office, led the moving rites.

In Legazpi, Governor Joey Salceda and Mayor Noel Rosal welcomed the tour group upon arrival.  Both officials hosted savory dinners showcasing the tourism potential and finest attractions of the province of Albay.  There, the spectacular Mount Mayon lured ATV adventurers to her lava wall while the seven-tiered Busay Falls beckoned visitors spoiling for a swim in tropical springs. A two-day retreat at the de luxe Misibis Bay resort recharged the participants for more exploits along their 10-day journey.

This year's itinerary also offered a pilgrimage to Our Lady of Peñafrancia in Naga City and a side trip to the Camarines Sur Watersports Complex where Governor Migz Villafuerte extended official hospitality.  Many takers of the optional excursion to Bulusan Lake and lunch at the Balay Buhay sa Uma Farm in Sorsogon enjoyed the tranquility of one of region's upcoming eco-destinations while building local capacity to receive more visitors.
Crossing over to the country's western coast, the "escapaders" revelled in the natural attractions that made Palawan the world's Best Island for two years in a row, based on Conde Nast Traveler's survey.  Hopping to the Cowrie, Pandan and Luli islands and visiting the famed Puerto Princesa Underground River, not to mention the cultural extravaganza staged by Mayor Lucilo Bayron, amounted to a most memorable stay for the guests.
Capping the tour, the farewell dinner hosted by the Tourism Promotions Board (TPB) verily lived up to the marketing campaign It's More Fun in the Philippines.
Winter Escapade 3 breaks records for being the biggest and longest tour tailored for visitors from Canada thus far. "From the solemn to the spiritual, from refreshing rains to glorious sunny weather, from pilgrimages to fun voyages - this year's tour had it all.  We were taken to church literally and figuratively to sanctuaries nurturing the human spirit and all sorts of life.  If asked to pick my favorite highlight of our tour, it would be our extended stay in Legazpi due to inclement weather.  The logistical challenges of the unexpected extension brought out the best in our Winter Escapade family.  It was a pity, however, to have missed the fabulous fellowship night organized by Western Union," Ambassador Garcia observed in her closing speech.
"We deeply appreciate the hard work put in by the Tourism Promotions Board, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Tourism, our tour handler Rajah Tours, project partner Western Union, Local Government Units (LGUs), the Philippine National Police (PNP), the Philippine Red Cross and provincial health officials, to make our sojourn one for the books," she added.
Already, plans are underway to launch Winter Escapade 4 in Canada this coming summer.  Interested parties are advised to await pertinent announcements from the Philippine Embassy in Ottawa and Consulates General in the Atlantic Provinces, Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and Vancouver.  END

Ambassador Garcia received her guests at the official residence in Ottawa also known as Tahanang Rizal (Rizal House).  In her welcome remarks, the Ambassador explained that "Dr. Jose Rizal is a 19th century renaissance man who understood and advanced the idea of gender equality in words and in deed.  His mother and sisters, in fact, played active roles in in our quest for liberty.  With them we share a passion in shaping our countries and our world according to our high aspirations for generations following us."
The Ambassador of the Republic of Albania and President of WAO, H.E. Elida Petoshati, thanked the Philippine Ambassador for responding to the suggestion that the latter host the group's first event for 2016 that gathered a "brilliant group of professionals and wonderful human beings."  Also present was Ms. Angela Bogdan, Chief of Protocol, Global Affairs Canada, who appreciated WAO as a "safe space to share experiences" and cited the group's broad reach for knowledge transfers.
"It was a privilege for me and WAO members to have as our guest of honor Dr. Janine Krieber who is renowned for her tremendous accomplishments and scholarly work on international relations, conflict sociology, identity conflicts, and terrorism.   It was also a pleasure for me to acquaint our distinguished guests with Philippine history and cuisine and other matters of mutual interest," Ambassador Garcia remarked.
 


The Women Ambassadors of Ottawa (WAO) is an informal grouping of female resident ambassadors and high commissioners accredited to Canada.
Dr. Krieber is a graduate of Université Laval and received a doctoral degree in Political Science from the Institut d'études politiques de Paris in 1992.

30 December 2015 - On the occasion of the 119th Anniversary of the Martyrdom of Dr. José Rizal, the Philippine Embassy led the observance of Rizal Day on 30 December 2015 at its chancery in Ottawa.
In his welcome remarks, Chargé d'Affaires, a.i. Uriel Norman R. Garibay reflected on this year's Rizal Day theme, Dangal ng Pilipino, Gabay sa Pagbabago.  CDA Garibay pointed to the national hero's martyrdom as a defining moment in the Philippine history which propelled the Filipino nation towards eventual independence and freedom.  He called upon civil servants to carry forward the struggle of our revolutionary heroes to attain genuine democracy and prosperity by applying themselves to public service.  Recalling Secretary of Foreign Affairs Albert F. Del Rosario's fundamental directive to the men and women of the Department of Foreign Affairs, he exhorted Philippine Embassy personnel to bring their full talent and brainpower to bear on their responsibilities and to reach beyond their grasp.  In the vernacular, he said "Kailangan natin na laging gunitain ang mga ginawa ni Dr. Rizal at ang mga sakripisyo ng ating mga bayani, sapagka't mayroon kabayanihan sa bawa't isa sa atin." (We need to always call to mind the deeds of Dr. Rizal and the sacrifices of our heroes because there is heroism in each of us.)
 

 
Mr. Garibay ended his remarks with the message of President Benigno S. Aquino on the occasion of Rizal Day.
In keeping with tradition, the commemorative program proceeded with a wreath laying ceremony followed by the reading of excerpts of Dr. Jose Rizal's timeless messages, a film showing and the singing of Pilipinas Kong Mahal.    END

18 December 2015 - The Ottawa Catholic School Board's (OCSB) Family Welcome Centre for Newcomers launched its very first Open House today in Nepean, Ottawa.  With Filipino Christmas as the event theme, the Centre invited staff of Catholic Education Centre to get better acquainted with the culture of the Filipino families they serve.
Ms. Denise André, OCSB Director of Education, welcomed and invited Philippine Ambassador Petronila P. Garcia to speak about Filipino Christmas traditions and her insights on Filipino culture.   After affirming the importance of a good Catholic education to Filipino migrant families, Ambassador Garcia delved into yuletide practices in the predominantly Catholic Philippines, both native and borrowed from the West.
Framing her remarks around the parol (Filipino Christmas lantern), the Ambassador went to the heart of Filipino customs and symbols celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.  She uncovered the significance of these traditions as they relate to the practice of the Christian faith as well as the cultural diversity and values shared by the Philippines and Canada that make friendship between the two countries "a match made in heaven."
"Like Canadians, Filipinos are a welcoming people.  Hospitality is a trait deeply embedded in Filipino culture," Ambassador Garcia explained.  Borrowing from the late President Corazon C. Aquinos remarks during her state visit to Canada in 1989, the Ambassador mused that a Canadian welcome is synonymous with Filipino hospitality.
"One other Christmas tradition shared by Filipinos and Canadians is gift-giving.  Like the evolving parol, our gift giving may be changing with the call of the times.  But whether gifts are given in boxes, envelopes or gestures, the essence of what we give or receive is what truly counts. And so I thank the OCSB today for the gift of the singular honour of this Open House and the warmest welcome not just for me but for my compatriots who followed the Star of Hope all the way to Canada," Ambassador Garcia concluded.
The Open House showcased Filipino Christmas lanterns handmade by members of the Filipino community in Ottawa and multicultural students from several Catholic schools in Ottawa.  A trivia quiz on the Philippines brought to the fore intriguing facts about the country.
The Philippines was the top source country for Canadian immigration in 2014 when 40,000 Filipinos were admitted to Canada as permanent residents. The figure represents a three-fold increase in a decade.  At 700,000 strong, Filipinos comprise one of Canada's biggest visible minorities.The OCSB helps newly-arrived families in the transition to their new lives in Canada, principally with regard to school registration.  The agency focuses on families and individuals, whether permanent residents, refugees, international studies, returning Canadian citizens or diplomats, whose home language is not English.
The OCSB runs programs covering French language courses, religious education, special education, driver education, international languages and English as a Second Language (ESL) in addition to adult high school and other continuing and community education programs. END

  			<a title="7 December 2015 - In keeping with the community's traditions, Filipino-Canadians in Ottawa staged the annual Pasko ng Bayan on 5 December 2015 at the Sandy Hill Community Centre.  A parol-making contest, a Christmas food contest and bazaar as well as a singing competition dubbed Pamaskong Palabas ng Pamilya at Barkada highlighted the community celebration of Christmas.
 

 
This year's Pasko ng Bayan saw a record number of Christmas lantern entries, both for the competition and exhibition, following workshops conducted by Mr. and Mrs. Ed Escares in October for adults and children.  Painstakingly handcrafted parols decked the hall in full Christmas ambience but one tiny entry handmade by Emma Riza Sapon stood out in the judges' eyes owing to an intricate handmade crèche embedded at the heart of the lantern.  Other entries presented by Lily and John Lay, Roger Guevarra, Laarni Casiple and the Hiligaynon Association earned prizes from Western Union and special mention from judges Nora Cote, Sonia del Rosario and Consul General Eric Tamayo.  Young participants in the parol workshop were also cited for their works, namely, Jacob Wilson, Samuel Wilson, Annabel Wilson, Gianna Casiple, Brianna Casiple, Elean Moreno, Luc Moreno, Tyson Lay, Shine Tejada and Gianpaolo Bragais.
Christmas food entries were judged by Chef Armando Baisas, Chef TJ David and Dr. Ruby Formoso.  Thelma Rogers' bangus sisig and leche flan garnered the best scores while Betty Obas' pork sisig and Bicol Express placed second.
Each Christmas carol presentation by Filipino-Canadian families and friends drew hearty applause from the audience.  Vanessa Merjudio-David and friends Jhune Leonardo and Mic Lomocso bagged the first prize for their a capella rendition of Carol of the Bells.  The Timog girls, Quitain Family and Kanata Songbirds placed fourth, third and second, respectively in the Pamaskong Palabas ng Pamilya at Barkada as judged by Vanessa Gomez, Bernice Reyes and Oliver Librada.
Pilipinong Migrante sa Canada participated in Pasko ng Bayan as guest performers along with 2014 Ottawa Idol Bernice Reyes, Nora Cote, Miguel Luis Moreno, Gianpaolo Bragais and Marie Mendillo.
 

"Our annual Pasko ng Bayan is where the Filipino community and the Embassy converge as organizer and participant at the same time. Our program encapsulates the sights, sounds and flavors of Christmas traditions we hold dear - the iconic parols that animated our Filipino Christmas spirit and unshakeable faith and hope in the Almighty's provisions; the traditional Filipino food reminiscent of our favorite carinderia, street food vendors in our home town or the very warmth of our mother's kitchen; and Filipino families and friends gamely joining forces to make all of us merry and bright.  The happiness we derive from the company of fellow Filipinos underpinned our Pasko ng Bayan activities.  On the underside of the parol, the food and the entertainment tonight, I heard the chatter of families and friends as they crafted the beautiful Christmas lanterns on display. At the bazaar, I saw our people's predisposition to feed the hungry. During the Christmas carols contest, I felt the Pinoy's irrepressible love for singing and compulsion to make others happy.  Filipino-Canadians have every reason to be proud of their heritage and their role as culture bearers transmitting admirable Filipino traditions and values not only to the younger generations but also to mainstream communities," Ambassador Petronila P. Garcia observed.
The annual Pasko ng Bayan is an initiative of the Philippine Embassy in Ottawa undertaken in partnership with the Filipino community.  Western Union and the St. Laurent Medical Centre Pharmacy were this year's contest sponsors, along with the Philippine Embassy, while community volunteer Marie Medillo emceed the program.  END

Amid the backdrop of the terrorist attacks in Paris, the suicide bombings in Lebanon, the lockdown in Brussels, and the mall attacks in Mali, as well as having three international flights diverted to its airport practically one after the other by bomb threats, the City of Halifax in Nova Scotia hosted the 7th and 2015 Edition of the Halifax International Security Forum (HISF) from 20 to 22 November 2015. The Honourable Canadian Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan welcomed all delegates and led all officials and military leaders of Canada in attendance.
Philippine Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio was among the distinguished roster of speakers at the forum which Maclean`s magazine billed as the definitive event where "people who wield power on matters of war and international security" converge, as the Magazine noted how "dozens of defence ministers, military leaders, think-tank leaders, academics and journalists will have it out on today's toughest global issues."
Joining Justice Carpio were Minister and Consul General Eric Gerardo Tamayo of the Philippine Embassy in Ottawa, Consul General, a.h. Sean Sears, and Vice Consul, a.h. Elizabeth Eustaquio-Domondon of the Philippine Consulate General in Halifax.
Justice Carpio shared top billing in the panel discussion held on 21 November at noon devoted to Broken China: Handle With Care, moderated by Ms. Lyse Doucet, Chief International Correspondent of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Joining Justice Carpio were Dr. Masashi Nishihara, President, Research Institute for Peace and Security; Admiral Michael Rogers, Commander, United States Cyber Command, Director National Security Agency / Chief, Central Security Service; and Dr. Russell Trood, Professor International Relations and Director of the Griffith Asia Institute, Griffith University
The panel discussion was framed by compelling introductory remarks by Admiral Harry T. Harris, Commander of the US Pacific Fleet who noted that "as China's economy has grown, so have its ambitions." Nevertheless, Admiral Harris underscored that US-China relations are more constructive than destructive.  The Admiral referred to the building spree of China in the South China Sea as "Sandcastles in the Sea" and as the "Great Wall of Sand" in referring to the "extreme scope" of China's claims. He indicated that adhering to international law is important and China cannot do whatever it pleases.
The Defense News magazine notes that the Philippines has filed a legal objection to China's activities in the South China Sea, and echoed the statement of Justice Carpio that the Philippines is no match for China, so it brought the dispute to a forum where armaments do not count. Justice Carpio emphasized that "we cannot live with a dispute where China claims everything."
Justice Carpio explained that it is hoped that the maritime dispute will be resolved in accordance with UNCLOS, but we still have that territorial dispute over the Spratlys. - and the way we propose to solve that is through the proposal of marine biologists - to say that the Spratlys  are the hatchery of the South China Sea - the fish that we catch in the South China Sea are spawned in the Spratlys.
Justice Carpio remarked that while China may not be broken, it is breaking the law by building artificial islands in international waters. He expressed concern that China will resort to declaring an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) once they have completed their building spree in the South China Sea. When asked what he would say to Chinese President Xi Jingping, Justice Carpio would recall what Deng Xiaoping aid at the United Nations in 1974 that "if one day China should change her color and turn into a superpower, if she too should play the tyrant in the world, and everywhere subject others to her bullying, aggression and exploitation, the people of the world should identify her as social-imperialism, expose it, oppose it and work together with the Chinese people to overthrow it." END

Executives of Jollibee USA called on H.E. Ambassador Petronila P. Garcia in Ottawa in a prelude to the opening of Jollibee stores across Canada.
Maribeth D. dela Cruz, Vice President and General Manager of Jollibee USA, with Mackey Dimaculangan, Operations Director, and Carol Rodriguez, Marketing Head for Jollibee, Red Ribbon, and Chowking, were welcomed by Ambassador Garcia, as well as DCM Norman Garibay, and Consul General Eric Gerardo Tamayo. They discussed Jollibee's efforts to open branches in areas of Canada where there are both high and dense concentrations of Filipino-Canadians, as well as a high patronage of quick service restaurants among Canadians.
The quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry in Canada is sustaining a growth trajectory. According to the Canadian Chain Restaurant Industry Review, an extensive research report commissioned by GE Capital and compiled by fsSTRATEGY and NPD Group Canada, the most frequent users of QSRs are Canadians aged 18 to 34, even as those belonging to the group of 55 years of age, are visiting QSRs more often.
The entry of Jollibee in Canada bodes well for the growing Filipino food movement in North America. This month, Filipino cuisine came into renewed prominence as the Philippine entry to the 2015 Embassy Chef Challenge was given two awards at the 2015 Embassy Chef Challenge in Ottawa on November 5. Filipino-Canadian chef Jil Aranas entered her version of kinulob na itik, an epicurean delight of the province of Laguna where she was raised before migrating to Canada at the age of 15.
Bolstering the movement further is the recent swing of the SALO project of Yana Gilbuena. In summer, Chef Gilbuena took her roving dinner project across Canada teaching diners the way of eating kamayan­style feasts (traditional Filipino method of eating with one's hands).
The year also saw the opening of the first and only Filipino food truck in Ottawa. Meryenda Snack Specializes in Filipino flavours with a fresh and unique twist from its founders Mark Coronel and Paul Castanos. With their combined restaurant experience and their shared love of Filipino Food, the two chefs decided that it was time to go into business for themselves and introduce Philippine cuisine to the Ottawa community.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation itself notes that Jollibee is well-known around the world for its pineapple-topped hamburgers, peach-mango pie and "Chickenjoy" fried chicken. The food chain has 2,833 stores worldwide and Jollibee Foods Corp. is the biggest fast food restaurant operator in The Philippines.  Many
Founded in 1978, Jollibee has branches across the globe and with 32 branches in the United States. Its entry into Canada follows the growing Filipino population in the country.
In 2014, the Philippines was the largest source country of new migrants into Canada. Almost 700,000 people of Filipino descent now call Canada their home. Tagalog is the fastest growing language, and Filipinos now comprise the third largest visible minority in the country.  END

  			<a title="Ottawa - Exotic and ecological, Philippine heirloom rice makes its debut in the Canadian market, as various varieties of the Filipino food staple are now available for online purchase across Canada in time for the holiday season. Up until this time, these treasured aromatic varieties were rarely sold in the commercial market.
Level Ground Trading, based in Victoria, British Columbia, has announced the availability of Philippine heirloom rice varieties coming from the japonica family, such as the Aromatic (ulikan), the Long Grain (mini-angan) red rice, and the Glutinous (ominio) sticky violet rice. Heretofore available only in the hinterlands of Luzon island, these varieties can now be delivered straight to Canadian households. Level Ground is solely responsible for the only shipment of rice exports from the Philippines this year.
The rice varieties are of significant cultural importance in the Cordillera region. The ulikan/mini-angan for one is traditionally given as a wedding gift to newlyweds, to bring prosperity and food security. It is steeped in folklore and legend among ethnic tribes in the Philippines as a gift from ancestral leaders.
Meanwhile, outside the Philippines, the ominio variety or violet rice itself can be cultivated only in Indonesia and Madagscar and is the preferred grain for preparing rice desserts and for making rice wine. The origin of the ominiio plays a significant role in the mythology of certain tribes in the Mountain Province. It is also known as balatinao, and kotinao, and its sticky properties is referred to as diket, chekat, daya'ot/dayakkot, jekot or chaycot.
The rice varieties are being offered in either 700 gram boxes I cases of six or 5 kilogram boxes. The rice is highly nutritious rice (one variety has up to 4g of protein/serving). They are 100% non-GMO varieties and are sun-dried, threshed and de-hulled in the Philippines. Farmers have made a commitment to only use organic fertilizers and disavow the use of any chemical. They can be readily ordered from http://www.levelground.com/store/shop/. Level Ground also markets coconut oil products coming from the Philippines as well.
Philippine Ambassador Petronila Garcia notes that "heirloom rice is tremendously important to the biodiversity of the place it is associated with." She expressed optimism that with heirloom, healthy and organic products gaining traction in the Canadian market, benefits will redound to all stakeholders concerned. It will also ensure the long term viability of rare Philippine varieties of rice.
Stacey Toews, Co-Founder and Communications Catalyst of Level Ground stands solidly behind the rice varieties saying that "at last - the beautiful heirloom rice from the Philippines is available." Level Ground Trading underwent a prolonged period of working with farmers and other stakeholders, and overcame various logistical challenges in bringing the rice varieties to the market. Level Ground notes "rice is a crop that has been greatly affected by the movement toward monoculture and the heavy emphasis on planting hybrid varieties. In the Philippines there still remains an incredible variety of heirloom rice." Philippine rice-producing partners of Level Ground are spread across 18 communities, stretching across 3 provinces of the Cordillera Region.
The availability of the rice varieties is testament to the collaborative work among Level Ground, the farmers and stakeholders and non-government organizations, as well that with the International Rice research Institute based in the Philippines, and the Philippine Department of Agriculture that also ensures and sustains the global genetic diversity of rice.
Traditional Philippine holiday staples such as the arroz caldo, biko, bibingka, kutsinta, palitao and puto bungbong will dazzle with the use of Philippine aromatic, long grain and glutinous rice now available in Canada, making the traditional Christmas Noche Buena feast and the New Year table setting a truly exceptional for this and the coming years. END

Moreover, the Philippines and Canada recently concluded an expanded air services agreement that holds the promise for greater two-way trade, investment and tourism flows. The Ambassador expressed optimism that the forum would enable everyone "to work on synergies between our two economies in how we do business with one another and the rest of the world."
For her part, Corrie MacDougall of the Ontario International Trade Branch of the Province of Ontario looked forward to the outcome of the business mission to the Philippines they are organizing in July 2015.

Ottawa - Ottawa's business, trade and diplomatic community came together on 30 October 2014 at the elite Rideau Club in Ottawa for the McDonald-Laurier Institute breakfast forum to discuss new prospects for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The event was an opportunity to hear from top experts on some of Canada's most important trade opportunities.
With TPP negotiations continuing in Australia, New Zealand High Commissioner Simon Tucker told a packed hall at the Rideau Club that he could sense that "momentum has tipped upward". He continued to say that the "TPP will grow over time, and Canada's trade opportunities will grow with it".
The group then discussed what will come after negotiations conclude with the original 12 member countries, including prospects for South Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan.
Trade expert and Macdonald-Laurier Institute Senior Fellow Laura Dawson reported on some of the findings of her new paper, Finding the Hidden Dragon, on increasing opportunities for trade with Taiwan, and the prospects for Taiwan joining TPP negotiations in the future. She told the audience, "Taiwan is all the things you want in a trade relationship with China, and none of the things you don't want".
Carleton business professor Ian Lee declared that "Europe is Canada's past, America is Canada's present, Asia is Canada's future".
As a country interested in joining the TPP, Philippine Minister and Consul General Eric Tamayo indicated that the Philippines has made the decision to join the TPP and a roadmap has been defined towards participation, noting inherent challenges "to the quality of trade that is being sought, or the standards demanded, under the TPP." Mr. Tamayo drew attention to efforts by the government in "implementing changes where it can, in easing trade and investment flows."
The event was moderated by MLI Managing Director Brian Lee Crowley and introductory remarks were made by Dean Allison, Member of Parliament and Chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, and Bruce Linghu, Special Representative of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Canada. The forum was organized with the co-operation with Dawson Strategic and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Ottawa. END

  			<a title="The Philippines is now a priority market for Canada.
Under the Global Markets Action Plan (GMAP) of Canada, the Philippines is now designated as a priority emerging market -- offering value and opportunity for a broad range of Canadian interests.
The designation is an affirmation of the positive developments concerning the Philippine economy which Canada now deems to demonstrate a high potential for economic growth, where Canadian capabilities have a best potential for success, and where government support, through economic diplomacy, can have the greatest impact.
The Philippinesnow becomes a priority country for facilitating foreign direct investment, and partnerships in technology and talent by the government of Canada in working with various Canadian enterprises.
Canada has identified priority areas for further commercial engagement.These are agriculture and agri-food, defense and security, education, Information and communications technologies, infrastructure, mining and sustainable technologies.
The Philippines joins 21 other economies across the globe as a priority emerging market for Canada. It now also joins other ASEAN partners such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam into the GMAP Emerging Market Priority Category.
The development bodes well for increased Philippines-Canada economic linkages and exchanges and provides a crucial boost in confidence for Canadian business in doing business with and in the Philippines. The designation comes after Canada named the Philippine as a country of focus for development aid in June this year.
As of 2013, total trade between the Philippines and Canada increased by 13.25% to C$1.7 Billion. The Philippines enjoys a trade surplus with Canada with Philippine exports increasing to C$1.14 Billion for the past year. Philippine imports from Canada stood at C$603.4 Million (as adjusted).
Further facilitating two-way trade is the recent expanded air services agreement between the two countries, increasing the frequency of flights and facilitating code sharing among air carriers. In 2013, the Philippines received 131,381 visitors from Canada making Canada the 8th largest source of tourists for the country. In January 2014, the first edition of the Winter Escapade - It's More Fun In The Philippines, helped spur economic activity in typhoon-devastated areas of Panay Island. END

  			<a title=" SASKATOON - A big dig unparalleled, 1.2 kilometers down and 10 kilometers out - throughout an alternating grid of perpendicular and parallel tunnels no more than 4 meters high by 8 meters wide - and boring through mineral deposits spanning approximately the total land territory of the Philippines, thus Team Philippines in Canada ventured into 300 million years of planetary tectonic shifts underneath Saskatchewan to rediscover first hand -- and literally unearth, the secret of the modern global sustainable agriculture and food industry, and one of its critical supply chain links - potash mining.
On the occasion of the Economic Diplomacy and Consular Mission of Team Philippines in Canada from 24 to 28 March 2013, Philippine Ambassador Leslie B. Gatan, accompanied by Philippine Consul General in Toronto Junever Mahilum-West, Minister for Economic Affairs Eric Tamayo and Labor Office Francisco Luna, probed the inner workings of a veritable potashopolis of sloping reserves, rolling winnepegosis reefs and other related seismic formations, and its connections with ensuring global food supply and agriculture and food productivity.
The tunnels are slowly closing in on themselves, the weight of millions of years and tons of potash bearing down on the caverns gouged out by massive boring machines - supported merely by 8 and 10 foot rods. The walls, floors and ceilings, when lit by the passing of specially-retrofitted vehicles, reveal the red and pink hues of the otherwise white crystalline potash meshed with traces of iron oxide.
Potash -- or potassium chloride, is one of three key nutrients essential for plant growth, the other two being nitrogen and phosphate. According to industry sources, potash is one of Canada's largest resources and a major export commodity -- and the country is experiencing a big bonanza of late as agriculture production across the globe continues to ramp up. With ten mines, Saskatchewan produces potash from reserves large enough to supply the world fertilizer demand for several hundred more years. Canada is the largest supplier of potash in the world.
The Philippines imports about 120,000 metric tons of potash from Canada, complementing the domestic phosphate industry and providing essential nutrients to support agricultural croplands producing among others sugar, rice, bananas, and corn. End

  			<a title="PHILIPPINES IS DESTINATION OF THE YEAR 2014
The Philippines is awarded the Destination of the Year at the 25th Annual TTG Travel Awards 2014, just a few months before the Department of Tourism (DOT) sets on to raise the country's international profile with its Visit the Philippines Year 2015 campaign.
Organized annually by the giant TTG Asia Media's Travel Trade Publishing group, the TTG Travel Awards has been recognizing the best of Asia-Pacific's travel trade since 1989. The prestigious travel industry event marks an important time for the industry to recognize the exemplary organizations that raise the bar of excellence. The exclusive event honors stellar organizations and individuals in 4 categories: Travel Supplier, Travel Agency, Outstanding Achievement, and Travel Hall of Fame.
DOT Travel Award 1.10.03.2014
Secretary of Tourism Ramon R. Jimenez Jr accepted the award before Asia's tourism professionals at the Awarding Ceremony and Gala Dinner held on 2 October 2014 at the Centara Grand and Bangkok Convention Center in Thailand. The Philippines was chosen as the region's most outstanding destination in 2014 for distinguishing itself with its proactive steps and initiatives towards the development and promotion of the travel industry. The Destination of the Year falls under the Outstanding Achievement Awards. Other categories include Travel Personality of the Year, Best Travel Entrepreneur, Best Marketing and Relationship Effort, and Best Trade Supporter. The winners are determined by TTG's editorial team.
"We would like to thank TTG for the invaluable support extended to our organization in our marketing and information dissemination efforts. As a trusted travel trade publication, it has been a formidable partner throughout these years in bringing the Philippines closer to our markets," DOT Secretary Ramon R. Jimenez Jr. said.
The TTG Travel Awards is now reputed as the most coveted and influential awards to be garnered in the region's travel industry. The signature trophy, a statuette of Hermes (the god of travel and protector of travellers in ancient Greek mythology), is cast in solid pewter and plated in 24K gold. Weighing two kilograms, the Hermes trophy has since then been the icon of the annual awards.DOT travel award 2.10.03.2014
"This award belongs to all Filipinos. It is the Filipino people that have ensured the acceptance of It's More Fun in the Philippines as a true and accurate description of the participative and active role every Filipino plays in ensuring a successful and enjoyable visit to the Philippines. Again, the determination of the Filipino people, coupled with the support of our President, Benigno S. Aquino III, is our inspiration to build a brighter tourism future for the Philippines-an industry that is more profitable and more inclusive," Secretary Jimenez concluded.
The DOT is gearing up its efforts to promote Visit the Philippines Year (VPY) 2015 - an invitation for all to experience the enduring promise of more fun in the Philippines. Encouraging nationwide participation, DOT aims to stamp passports of 10 million visitors to the Philippines as the country hosts major events such as the Papal Visit in January and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meetings and Leaders' Summit.

  			<a title="10 March 2012 - The Philippine Embassy in Ottawa reported to the Department that Ambassador Leslie B. Gatan led Philippine participation in the 18th Ottawa Travel and Vacation show held on 10-11 March 2012 at the Ottawa Convention Centre.

Ambassador Gatan joined the Honorable Diana Ablonczy, Minister of State of Foreign Affairs, and His Worship, Mayor Jim Watson, at the ceremonies opening the show. In his welcome remarks, Mayor Watson hailed the travel show for enabling visitors to travel around the world in one hour.  He also cited the saleability of culinary, heritage and cultural trips to Canada's ageing population.  Minister Ablonczy opened the show which she regarded as a "tremendous way of building bridges and friendships around the world."  Describing Canadians as adventuresome, she noted that 56 million trips, out of a population of 33 million, are made by Canadians each year.  She encouraged Canadian travellers to observe the three R's (Read, Register and Reach Us) when taking trips abroad.
The Ambassador discussed Philippine destinations with exhibitors and other visitors to the Philippine booth that included Minister Ablonczy herself.

Since participating in travel shows in Canada several years ago, more and more tour operators have been selling Philippine packages.  These include Tours Hai International, Jade Tours, Handa Travel, and Royal Scenic, among others.  At the show, there was palpable interest in selling more Philippine destinations as demonstrated by Uniktour, Travel Professionals International and Family Travel Scoop.

The forthcoming 7th Ambassadors, Consuls General and Tourism Directors (ACGTD) Tour was also earnestly marketed by the Philippine Embassy with promising results.  The Embassy launching of the ACGTD Tour will take place in Ottawa and Montreal on 15 and 16 March 2012, respectively.
Besides tourism, the Philippine Embassy took the occasion to promote Philippine products and food.  Filipino shell craft, baskets and the turon were the top drawers inviting queries and compliments from visitors.
Philippine participation in the travel show was organized by the Philippine Department of Tourism office in New York represented by Ms. Mitchelle T. Dy, Deputy Director for Marketing.
Visited by some 16,000 travel-ready Canadians, the 18th Ottawa Travel and Visitors Show boasted over 190 travel and vacation exhibits from over 50 countries.  Ottawa is home to 1.2 million well-educated, affluent Canadians with the second highest per capita income of all major Canadian cities.
"Filipinos in Canada are well-placed to persuade their Canadian friends to take an interest in a Philippine vacation, as Canadian visitors to the Philippine booth proved.  Together with the Filipino community, the Embassy hopes to generate more buzz for Philippine destinations in line with its economic diplomacy program," Ambassador Gatan stated. END

The island, a well-established tourist destination in the Philippines, is one of the 17 areas featured in Travel + Leisure's "Best Secret Beaches on Earth" feature, which is part of the magazine's March 2012 issue.
"An hour-long flight from Manila to Bohol island followed by a 25-minute drive across a 19th-century causeway brings you to this secluded Central Visayas isle," author David Keeps wrote in the Travel + Leisure article.
Keeps particularly cited the Ananyana Beach Resort and Spa, which "occupies a prime spot on a mile-long stretch of sand."
"The 12 luxe thatched-roof huts have bamboo-framed king-size beds; the al fresco restaurant turns out Filipino-Mediterranean dishes such as penne with pork adobo; and the lounge is outfitted with regionally made rattan and abaca furniture," he wrote.
"Hop a resort boat for dolphin watching, diving amid the drop-offs of Balicasag island, or, for the ultimate castaway fantasy, a sunset dinner on deserted Puntod Island," he added.
The article also recommended other sites in Bohol such as the Bohol Bee Farm, which serves dishes such as homemade ube (purple yam) ice cream, and the Chocolate Hills, which was described as "a surreal wonder of 1,776 dome-shaped hills formed from limestone covered in grass."
Meanwhile, here are the other beaches that made it to the list of Travel + Leisure's best secret beaches:

  			<a title="08 July 2015 -A high-level Philippine team for the UNCLOS arbitration case being heard by an arbitral tribunal in The Hague has begun presenting the arguments for the Philippine position, with emphasis on the tribunal's jurisdiction to hear and decide the case.
On the first day of the oral arguments on 7 July 2015, Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Albert del Rosario explained the reasons for the Philippines' decision to seek arbitration in its maritime dispute with China.
"China has pursued its activities in these disputed maritime areas with overwhelming force. The Philippines can only counter by invoking international law. That is why it is of fundamental importance to the Philippines, and we would submit, for the rule of law in general, for the Tribunal to decide where and to what limit China has maritime entitlements in the South China Sea; where and to what limit the Philippines has maritime entitlements; where and to what extent the Parties' respective entitlements overlap and where they do not. None of this requires or even invites the Tribunal to make any determinations on questions of land sovereignty, or delimitation of maritime boundaries," Secretary del Rosario stated.  He made an impassioned plea for the tribunal to recognize its jurisdiction over a case laden with ramifications for the application of the rule of law in maritime disputes not only in the South China Sea but elsewhere in the world.
The full text of Secretary del Rosario's speech is attached.
On the second day of the oral arguments, the Philippines' lawyers will further explain how the Philippine case did not fall under the specific UNCLOS exemptions that preclude the tribunal from hearing the case. They also will present arguments manifesting the strength of the Philippines' environmental and fishing claims against China.
The Philippine legal team is expected to summarize the Philippines' case and reply to questions to be raised by the tribunal before the oral arguments conclude on July 13. END

WHY THE PHILIPPINES BROUGHT THIS CASE TO ARBITRATION AND ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE REGION AND THE WORLD Republic of the Philippines v. People's Republic of China
STATEMENT BEFORE THE PERMANENT COURT OF ARBITRATION H.E. Albert F. del Rosario, Secretary of Foreign Affairs7 July 2015
1.	Mr. President, distinguished Members of the Tribunal, it is a great honor to respectfully appear before you on behalf of my country, the Republic of the Philippines. It is indeed a special privilege to do so in a case that has such importance to all Filipinos and -- if I may add -- to the rule of law in international relations.
2.	Mr. President, the Philippines has long placed its faith in the rules and institutions that the international community has created to regulate relations among States. We are proud to have been a founding member of the United Nations, and an active participant in that indispensable institution.
3.	Its organs, coupled with the power of international law, serve as the great equalizer among States, allowing countries, such as my own, to stand on an equal footing with wealthier, more powerful States.
4.	Nowhere is this more true, Mr. President, than with respect to the progressive development of the law of the sea, which culminated in the adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention in 1982.  That instrument, which has rightly been called a "Constitution for the Oceans," counts among its most important achievements the establishment of clear rules regarding the peaceful use of the seas, freedom of navigation, protection of the maritime environment and, perhaps most importantly, clearly defined limits on the maritime areas in which States are entitled to exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction.
5.	These are all matters of central significance to the Philippines.  Indeed, given our lengthy coastline, our status as an archipelagic state, and our seafaring tradition, the rules codified in the law of the sea have always had particular importance for the Philippines. The Philippines is justifiably proud of the fact that it signed the Convention on the day it was opened for signature, on 10 December 1982, and was one of the first States to submit its instrument of ratification, which it did on 8 May 1984.
6.	The Philippines has respected and implemented its rights and obligations under the Convention in good faith. This can be seen in the amendment of our national legislation to bring the Philippines' maritime claims into compliance with the Convention, by converting our prior straight baselines into archipelagic baselines in conformity with Articles 46 and 47, and by providing that the maritime zones of the Kalayaan Island Group and Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea would be consistent with Article 121.
7.	The Philippines took these important steps, Mr. President, because we understand, and accept, that compliance with the rules of the Convention is required of all States Parties.
8.	I mentioned a moment ago the equalizing power of international law.  Perhaps no provisions of the Convention are as vital to achieving this critical objective than Part XV.  It is these dispute resolution provisions that allow the weak to challenge the powerful on an equal footing, confident in the conviction that principles trump power; that law triumphs over force; and that right prevails over might.
9.	Mr. President, allow me to respectfully make it clear: in submitting this case, the Philippines is NOT asking the Tribunal to rule on the territorial sovereignty aspect of its disputes with China.
10.	We are here because we wish to clarify our maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, a question over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction. This is a matter that is most important not only to the Philippines, but also to all coastal States that border the South China Sea, and even to all the States Parties to UNCLOS. It is a dispute that goes to the very heart of UNCLOS itself. Our very able counsel will have much more to say about this legal dispute over the interpretation of the Convention during the course of these oral hearings. But in my humble layman's view, the central legal dispute in this case can be expressed as follows:
11.	For the Philippines, the maritime entitlements of coastal States - to a territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, and the rights and obligations of the States Parties within these respective zones - are established, defined and limited by the express terms of the Convention. Those express terms do not allow for - in fact they preclude - claims to broader entitlements, or sovereign rights, or jurisdiction, over maritime areas beyond the limits of the EEZ or continental shelf. In particular, the Convention does not recognize, or permit the exercise of, so called "historic rights" in areas beyond the limits of the maritime zones that are recognized or established by UNCLOS.
12.	Sadly, China disputes this, Mr. President, in both word and deed. It claims that it is entitled to exercise sovereign rights and jurisdiction, including the exclusive right to the resources of the sea and seabed, far beyond the limits established by the Convention, based on so-called "historic rights" to these areas. Whether these alleged "historic rights" extend to the limits generally established by China's so-called "nine dash line", as appears to be China's claim, or whether they encompass a greater or a narrower portion of the South China Sea, the indisputable fact, and the central element of the legal dispute between the Parties, is that China has asserted a claim of "historic rights" to vast areas of the sea and seabed that lie far beyond the limits of its EEZ and continental shelf entitlements under the Convention.
13.	In fact, China has done much more, Mr. President, than to simply claim these alleged "historic rights." It has acted forcefully to assert them, by exploiting the living and non-living resources in the areas beyond the UNCLOS limits while forcibly preventing other coastal States, including the Philippines, from exploiting the resources in the same areas - even though the areas lie well within 200 M of the Philippines' coast and, in many cases, hundreds of miles beyond any EEZ or continental shelf that China could plausibly claim under the Convention.
14.	The legal dispute between the Philippines and China over China's claim to and exercise of alleged "historic rights" is a matter falling under the Convention, and particularly Part XV, regardless of whether China is claiming that "historic rights" are recognized under the Convention, or allowable under the Convention because they are not precluded by it. China has made both arguments in its public statements. But it makes no difference for purposes of the characterization of this dispute as one calling for the interpretation or application of the Convention. The question raised by the conflicting positions of the Philippines and China boils down to this: Are maritime entitlements to be governed strictly by UNCLOS, thus precluding claims of maritime entitlements based on "historic rights"? Or does the UNCLOS allow a State to claim entitlements based on "historic" or other rights even beyond those provided for in the Convention itself?
15.	As our counsel will explain, Mr. President, any recognition of such "historic rights" conflicts with the very character of UNCLOS and its express provisions concerning the maritime entitlements of coastal States. This calls indisputably for the proper interpretation of the fundamental nature of the Convention.
16.	China's assertion and exercise of its alleged rights in areas beyond its entitlements under UNCLOS have created significant uncertainty and instability in our relations with China and in the broader region. In this respect, I note the presence here today of representatives of Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan to observe these critical proceedings.
17.	Mr. President, China has claimed "historic rights" in areas that are beyond 200 M from its mainland coasts, or any land feature over which it claims sovereignty, and within 200 M of the coasts of the Philippines' main islands, and exploited the resources in these areas while preventing the Philippines from doing so. It has therefore, in the Philippines' view, breached the Convention by violating Philippine sovereign rights and jurisdiction. China has pursued its activities in these disputed maritime areas with overwhelming force. The Philippines can only counter by invoking international law. That is why it is of fundamental importance to the Philippines, and we would submit, for the rule of law in general, for the Tribunal to decide where and to what limit China has maritime entitlements in the South China Sea; where and to what limit the Philippines has maritime entitlements; where and to what extent the Parties' respective entitlements overlap and where they do not. None of this requires or even invites the Tribunal to make any determinations on questions of land sovereignty, or delimitation of maritime boundaries.
18.	The Philippines understands that the jurisdiction of this tribunal convened under UNCLOS is limited to questions that concern the law of the sea. With this in mind, we have taken great care to place before you only claims that arise directly under the Convention.  As counsel for the Philippines will discuss at length in the coming days, we have, in essence, presented five (5) principal claims.  They are:
a.	First, that China is not entitled to exercise what it refers to as "historic rights" over the waters, seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of its entitlements under the Convention;b.	Second, that the so-called nine dash line has no basis whatsoever under international law insofar as it purports to define the limits of China's claim to "historic rights";c.	Third, that the various maritime features relied upon by China as a basis upon which to assert its claims in the South China Sea are not islands that generate entitlement to an exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.  Rather, some are "rocks" within the meaning of Article 121, paragraph 3; others are low-tide elevations; and still others are permanently submerged. As a result, none are capable of generating entitlements beyond 12M, and some generate no entitlements at all.  China's recent massive reclamation activities cannot lawfully change the original nature and character of these features;d.	Fourth, that China has breached the Convention by interfering with the Philippines' exercise of its sovereign rights and jurisdiction; and e.	Fifth, that China has irreversibly damaged the regional marine environment, in breach of UNCLOS, by its destruction of coral reefs in the South China Sea, including areas within the Philippines' EEZ, by its destructive and hazardous fishing practices, and by its harvesting of endangered species.
19.	Mr. President, the Philippines is committed to resolving its disputes with China peacefully and in accordance with international law.  For over two decades, we diligently pursued that objective bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally.  I will not here take this Tribunal through the Philippines' painstaking and exhaustive diplomatic efforts, which are set out in detail in our written pleadings.  I will, however, mention a few representative examples, if I may.
20.	As far back as August 1995, after China seized and built structures on Mischief Reef -- a low-tide elevation located 126 nautical miles from the Philippine island of Palawan and more than 600 nautical miles from the closest point on China's Hainan Island -- the Philippines sought to address China's violation of its maritime rights diplomatically. During those exchanges, the Philippines and China agreed that the dispute should be resolved in accordance with UNCLOS.  As the then Chinese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Tang Jiaxuan, stated two years later during bilateral negotiations, China and the Philippines should "approach the disputes on the basis of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, particularly its provisions on the maritime regimes like the exclusive economic zone."
21.	The mutual acceptance that the Philippines' disputes with China must be resolved in accordance with UNCLOS was also reflected in a Joint Communiqué issued in July 1998 upon completion of bilateral discussions between my predecessor, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, and China's Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.  The Communiqué recorded that, and I quote, "The two sides exchanged views on the question of the South China Sea and reaffirmed their commitment that the relevant disputes shall be settled peacefully in accordance with the established principles of international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea." (End of quote)
22.	Regrettably, neither the bilateral exchanges I have mentioned, nor any of the great many subsequent exchanges, proved capable of resolving the impasse caused by China's intransigent insistence that China alone possesses maritime rights in virtually the entirety of the South China Sea, and that the Philippines must recognize and accept China's sovereignty before meaningful discussion of other issues could take place.
23.	The Philippines has also been persistent in seeking a diplomatic solution under the auspices of ASEAN.  This has proven no more successful than our bilateral efforts.  In fact, China has insisted that ASEAN cannot be used to resolve any territorial or maritime disputes concerning the South China Sea, and that such issues can only be dealt with in bilateral negotiations.  ASEAN and China have yet to conclude a binding code of conduct in the South China Sea.  The most that has been achieved was the issuance, in 2002, of a "Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea."  Although that document recorded the parties' commitment to work toward the "eventual" establishment of a code of conduct in the South China Sea, China's intransigence in the 13 years of subsequent multilateral negotiations has made that goal nearly unattainable.
24.	Nonetheless, Mr. President, the 2002 DOC is significant in at least one important respect: the ASEAN Member States and China undertook therein to "resolve their territorial and jurisdictional disputes by peaceful means, without resorting to the threat or use of force, through friendly consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned, in accordance with universally recognized principles of international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."  In so doing, the Declaration encouraged those States, should they prove unable to resolve their disputes through consultations or negotiations, to do so in accordance with the Convention, which includes, of course, the dispute resolution procedures under Part XV.
25.	Mr. President, over the years, China's positions and behavior have become progressively more aggressive and disconcerting. Outside observers have referred to this as China's "salami-slicing" strategy:  that is, taking little steps over time, none of which individually is enough to provoke a crisis. Chinese military officials themselves have referred to this as its "cabbage" strategy: peeling one layer off at a time. When these small steps are taken together, however, they reflect China's efforts to slowly consolidate de facto control throughout the South China Sea.
26.	Two more recent incremental steps caused the Philippines to conclude that it had no alternative other than to invoke compulsory procedures entailing a binding decision.  The first was China's transmittal of its nine-dash line claim to the United Nations in 2009, after which, it prevented the Philippines from carrying out long-standing oil and gas development projects in areas that are well inside the Philippines' 200 M EEZ and continental shelf.
27.	Secondly, in 2012, China forcibly expelled Philippine fishermen from the maritime areas around Scarborough Shoal where the Filipino fishermen have for generations been fishing without so much as a protest from China.
28.	These and other acts by China caused the Philippines to conclude that continued diplomatic efforts, whether bilateral or multilateral, would be futile, and that the only way to resolve our maritime disputes was to commence the present arbitration.
29.	Subsequent events, including China's acceleration of massive land reclamation activities, which it has undertaken -- and continues to undertake -- in blatant disregard of the Philippines rights' in its EEZ and continental shelf, and at tremendous cost to the marine environment in violation of UNCLOS -- only serve to reconfirm the need for judicial intervention.
30.	Mr. President, I would like to conclude by conveying my country's deepest appreciation for the considerable time and attention you have devoted to these proceedings.  The case before you is of the utmost importance to the Philippines, to the region, and to the world.  In our view, it is also of utmost significance to the integrity of the Convention, and to the very fabric of the "legal order for the seas and oceans" that the international community so painstakingly crafted over many years.
31.	If China can defy the limits placed by the Convention on its maritime entitlements in the South China Sea, and disregard the entitlements of the Philippines under the Convention, then what value is there in the Convention for small States Parties as regards their bigger, more powerful and better armed neighbors? Can the Philippines not invoke Part XV to challenge China's activities as violations of its obligations and the Philippines' rights, considering that the Philippines' claims call for a mere interpretation and application of the Convention and do not fall within any of the jurisdictional exclusions of Articles 297 or 298?
32.	Mr. President, if the Philippines cannot invoke Part XV, then what remains of the obligation regarding judicial settlement of disputes that was such a key element of the comprehensive package that made the Convention acceptable to all State Parties?
33.	We understand, Mr. President, that in the exercise of its collective wisdom and judgment, this body has decided to bifurcate the proceedings and to limit these current hearings to the issue of jurisdiction. In this respect, we shall explain in full how our case falls squarely within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, to the end that justice and fair play may prevail and the Tribunal would recognize its jurisdiction over the case and allow the Philippines to present the actual merits of our position.
34.	In the Philippines' view, it is not just the Philippines' claims against China that rest in your capable hands. Mr. President, it is the spirit of UNCLOS itself. That is why, we submit, these proceedings have attracted so much interest and attention. We call on the Tribunal to kindly uphold the Convention and enable the rule of law to prevail.
35.	I humbly thank you, Mr. President, and distinguished Members of the Tribunal. May I now ask that Philippines' counsel, Mr. Paul Reichler, be called to the podium.

  			<a title="08 July 2015 - The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) advises the public to be alert to the modus operandi of drug syndicates, as well as the profile of recruiters working for them and their victims, as described below. The information on the modus operandi of drug syndicates is based on the report from the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA).
Modus Operandi of Drug Syndicates in Recruiting Drug Couriers
Drug syndicate recruiters meet potential victims through casual acquaintances or through the Internet in order to befriend, enter into a relationship and/or marry the victim. The potential drug courier is lured or attracted by the offer of payment of US$3,000 up to US$15,000 for every successful delivery or transaction. They are provided with plane tickets and hotel accommodations. African Drug Syndicate (ADS) members, in particular, are engaged in the importation of illegal drugs in low amounts at a high frequency.
Profile of Drug Couriers
Drug couriers that have been caught are mostly male. Some are displaced overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who are looking for a job abroad. Some have a poor educational background. However, some drug couriers are also, in fact, well-educated. In their case, they were lured by drug syndicates who offered them "easy money" and the opportunity to travel to different countries. Drug syndicate recruiters also take advantage of a potential victim's desire to enter into a relationship or marriage.
Why are drug syndicates recruiting Filipinos in particular?
Drug syndicates target Filipinos specifically for their proficiency in the English language, their ability to speak other languages, and their skill with computers and the Internet. Filipinos are deemed by drug syndicates to have an "unassuming behavior" which attracts less attention from police or airport authorities. Filipinos also, in general, have a positive disposition which drug syndicate recruiters exploit.
A Reminder to the Public:
Observe the Law When Traveling, Be Extra Careful and Alert
We appeal to all Filipinos not to be victimized by international drug syndicates and to avoid falling for the modus operandi employed by drug trafficking syndicates.
We call for personal vigilance and responsibility on the part of Filipinos who travel abroad. We remind our kababayans that the laws imposed by host countries govern cases of drug trafficking.
We hope that this information will help our kababayans to be more equipped in preventing themselves from becoming victims of drug syndicates. END
