You should also bring your valid Medicare card.</p><h3 style="color: #c00;"><strong>What to Bring</strong></h3><p>Although the hospital provides hospital gowns, you may feel more comfortable in your own pyjamas/clothing, housecoat, and slippers/shoes. You should bring a toothbrush, toothpaste, tissues, shaving items, soap, skin lotion, sanitary supplies and other personalcare articles. Since storage is limited, you are asked not to bring large suitcases. Please bring all medications that you are taking.

You should also bring your valid Medicare card and Montreal General Hospital card. If you do not have a Montreal General Hospital card, the Admissions Office staff will make one for you. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Valuables&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please do not bring any items of value. If you do, you will be asked to turn them over for safekeeping or to sign a form, which releases the hospital of any responsibility. If a theft or a loss occurs, you should immediately make a report to your nurse. While most people wear their wedding rings, you should leave valuable watches, precious jewellery, cash, and credit cards at home. Bring only enough money to pay for the phone or television service or for incidental items.

The patient and family are considered partners in care. The patient will identify their family or significant support.<br /><br />It is important for the healthcare staff to be able to provide care while maintaining a supportive and comfortable environment for patient and family. The number of family members and visitors in the room is dependent upon the condition and of the patient(s) in the room. Guidelines for the presence of family and visitors will be flexible and will respond to the preferences and changing needs of the patient.&nbsp;<br /><br />In some circumstances, an individualized visiting plan may be developed to respond to the needs of a specific patient and family or a safety-related concern. It will be developed collaboratively with patient, family and clinical staff.<br /><br />Visitors are guests of the patient. Regular visiting hours (which do not apply to family) are from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. This may change based on patient/nursing needs. Children under the age of 12 must be accompanied and supervised by an adult. For the patientâs privacy, visitors and family may be asked to leave the patient room for a short period of time.<br /><br />Speak to the patientâs nurse about facilities available for staying overnight<br /><br />By following these simple rules<strong>&nbsp;</strong>you will help promote patient healing and recovery:</p><ul>â¢&nbsp;Wash hands before and after visiting patients&nbsp;<br />â¢&nbsp;Respect the posted Infection Control Signs on patient room doors<br />â¢&nbsp;Respect restricted visiting rights. This normally occurs during an outbreak of a contagious illness.<br />â¢&nbsp;Do not touch patientsâ wound coverings, tubing or equipment at bedsides&nbsp;<br />â¢&nbsp;Do not visit if sick with fever, cough, diarrhea or rash&nbsp;<br />â¢ Ensure our belongings are locked or with you at all times. &nbsp;The hospital is a public place and staff cannot be held accountable if items are stolen</ul><p>Mutual respect between family, visitors and healthcare staff is essential. Courteous and respectful behaviour is a requirement.</p></div>
