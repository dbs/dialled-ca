<h3>December 21, 2015</h3>
<p>The practice of law and the public’s demands for legal services are changing.  Driven in part by new technologies, new business models and access to justice concerns, delivery and regulation of legal services has begun evolving around the world.  We have been watching significant regulatory changes in Australia, England and Wales over the last ten years. These ideas have caught on in Canada, as is reflected in the recommendations of the Canadian Bar Association’s recent Futures Report. To keep up with these changes, the Law Society must also rethink its regulation of the profession.</p>
<p>The Law Societies of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are trying to stay ahead of this wave. In particular, we are examining a spectrum of regulatory tools that includes entity regulation, compliance-based regulation and alternative business structures to determine which, if any, might be effective in our jurisdictions.  A discussion paper co-authored by representatives of each of these law societies represents an early step in both understanding and assessing the regulatory options available. </p>
<p>These new approaches to regulation do not necessarily mean more regulation, but a different approach to regulation that is more proactive.  They can also mean increased flexibility and opportunity for the profession in the delivery of legal services.  That’s why we want your input. The next step in examining these issues is a consultation with the profession in early 2016.  In the meantime, we hope this paper will provide some background information to inform the consultation process.  Please follow the links to read the <a href="/media/127107/INNOVATINGREGULATION.pdf">paper</a> and <a href="/media/127103/ABSTRACTInnovatingRegulation.pdf">accompanying abstract</a>.  </p>

<p>The Law Society is working with the Ministry of Justice to explore possibilities for allowing non-lawyers to provide some legal services in Saskatchewan.  The possibilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>expanding the scope of paralegals working under the supervision of lawyers;</li>
<li>relaxing the restrictions on other types of professionals who provide services akin to legal services; and</li>
<li>creating a new class of legal service providers who would be permitted to provide some legal services independently after undergoing training and assessment. </li>
</ul>
<p><br />The project’s overall goal is to provide greater access to legal services for Saskatchewan citizens. </p>
<p>The Law Society and the Ministry are beginning informal discussions with individual paralegals and their associations to better understand the current market. In particular, we are gathering information about the current environment, including how many non-lawyers are working in any legal capacity or are delivering some kind of informal legal service in Saskatchewan. </p>
<p>The second stage will be to undertake wider consultations with all affected stakeholders, including the courts, the profession in general, Crown corporations, Saskatchewan Trial Lawyers Association, Collaborative Law, Canadian Bar Association, Pro Bono Law, Public Legal Education Association, CLASSIC, Legal Aid, tribunals, community based organizations, notaries, paralegals, the public, insurance brokers, financial planners, and estate planners. </p>
<p>If you know of any other individuals or organizations that might be interested in providing input, or if you are interested in otherwise contributing to this project, please contact Barbra Bailey at <a href="mailto:barbra@lawsociety.sk.ca">barbra@lawsociety.sk.ca</a>. </p>
