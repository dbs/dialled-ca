        History:</font><br>
        <br>
          
        
        In 1808 the Hudson's Bay Company established an outpost at Big Beaver House, 
        which is located approximentely 12 kilometres southwest of the present 
        Kingfisher Lake reserve. Big Beaver House was frequented by Kingfisher Lake 
        people for trading fur, community activity and freight hauling employment.<br>
        <br>
          
       	During 1929 -1930 
       	          the leaders of Kingfisher Lake First Nation were required to gather at 
       	          Big Trout Lake and participate in the siging of the adhesion to Treaty 
       	          Number 9. As the result of this document, Kingfisher Lake was consider 
       	          a part of Big Trout Lake Band.<br>
        <br>
          
       	In 1947 the Ontario 
       	          Government enacted the trapline registration and fee program which eventually 
       	          forced the Kingfisher Lake people to outline their ancestral hunting areas 
       	          into trapping boundries and also to pay for the land use requirements.<br>
        <br>
          
       	In 1964 the leaders 
       	          of Kingfisher Lake decide to establish permanent community and moved 
       	          to the current location of the reserve lands. As Kingfisher Lake was already 
       	          included in the Big Trout Lake Band and thus had reserve status, formality 
       	          of gaining band status was achieved in 1975.<br>
        <br>
          
       	In 1984 
       	          Kingfisher Lake band along with several other neighbouring first nations 
       	          agreed to form the Shibogama First Nation Council through a legal corporation<br>
