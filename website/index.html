<h1>DIALLED: Distributed Index of All Library Location and Event Data</h1>
<p>
    This project maintains a linked open dataset listing all (<em>as many as we
    are aware of</em>) of the
    libraries, archives, and museums in Canada, along with their locations,
    geographic coordinates, hours, and other meta-institutional data. We
    periodically harvest the linked data embedded in the canonical web page for
    each site and aggregate and redistribute that data for easy public consumption
    and reuse.
</p>

<h2>Help build DIALLED</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Fast and easy</em>: Ensure each location for your institution <a
    href="https://goo.gl/ZpsB8M">is listed with the correct URL</a>. We can't
    include your institution if we don't know about it!
</li>
<li><em>More involved</em>: Create or maintain lists of institutions for your
    province or sector. For example, Manitoba lists all of their public libraries
    but only in a non-machine-readable PDF file. Creating an HTML version of that
    would enable us to ensure all of those libraries are properly represented in
    DIALLED.
</li>
<li><em>More effort, but really valuable</em>: Add linked data to your institution's home page!

    My article "<a
    href="https://journal.lib.uoguelph.ca/index.php/perj/article/view/3328">White
    Hat Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Structured Web Data for Libraries</a>",
    published in <em>Partnership: The Canadian Journal of Library and Information
    Practice and Research</em>, gently walks you through the process of augmenting an
    existing library web page with rich schema.org linked data. It also discusses
    the importance of <code>robots.txt</code> and sitemap files for ensuring the
    visibility of your library website.

<li>Enhance the dialled.ca aesthetic. You might have noticed it's stark. If you
    have design skills, I welcome them!</li>
<li>Write HTML scrapers. Some sets of institutions have easily recognized patterns
    for how they represent their contact information, hours, etc. We don't have to
    be purists about how we generate our linked open dataset; if the source web sites
    can't or won't add structured data, then we can figure it out ourselves!</li>
<li>Contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/dbs/dialled-ca">DIALLED crawler source code</a>.
    We use Python3 with the RDFLib library for the bulk of our effort, and our code is
    licensed under the GPLv3.</li>
